     ramose and his mothernow when by the favour of the most high god him whom i worship towhom every man is gathered at last now i say when i am old manyhave urged upon me that i ramose should set down certain of thosethings that i have seen in the days of my life and particularly thetale of the fall of babylon the mighty city before cyrus thepersian which chanced when he whom the greeks called nabonidus beingnewly dead belshazzar his son was kingtherefore having ever been a lover of letters this i do in thegrecian tongue here in my house at memphis the great city of thenile whereof today i am the governor under darius the persian forit has pleased god after many adversities to bring me to this peaceand dignity at last whether any will read this book when it iswritten or whether it will perish with me i do not know nor indeeddoes it trouble me much since none can tell the end of anything goodor ill and all must happen as it is decreed man makes a beginningbut the rest is in the hands of fate indeed his life itself is but abeginning of which the end is hidnow today when he is almost forgotten i can say without fear that iam a kings son for my father was none other than the pharaoh uahabra whom the greeks called apries and the hebrews hophra nor is myblood all royal seeing that i was not the son of the wife of pharaohbut of one of his women a grecian lady named chloe the daughter ofchion an athenian by birth of whom the less said the better for mymother told me that being a spendthrift and in want of money heturned her beauty to account by giving her to apries in exchange for agreat present i know no more of the matter because she would seldomspeak of it saying that it was shameful adding only that her fatherwas wellborn that her mother had died when she was an infant andthat before she came to the court at sais they saw many changes offortune living sometimes in wealth but for the most part humbly andin great poverty which in after years bred in her a love of rank andricheshere in the palace of sais during the little time that my mother wasin favour with pharaoh i was born and here i lived till i was ayoung man grown being brought up with the sons of the great noblesand taught all things that one of my station should know especiallythe art of war and how to ride and handle weapons further i gotlearning because always from the first i loved it being taught manythings by greek masters who were about the court as well as byegyptians also by a certain babylonian named belus a doctor who wasversed in strange lore concerning the stars of this belus my masterand friend but for whom i should long ago be dead i shall have muchto tellthus it came about that in the end i could read and speak greek aswell as i could egyptian which was not to be wondered at seeing thati learned it at my mothers breast also i mastered the babylonian orchaldean tongue though not so well and with it the curious writingof that peopleof my father the pharaoh i saw little for he had so many childrensuch as i born of different mothers that he took small heed of ushe upon whom lay this hard fortune that from those who were hisqueens according to the law of egypt he had no offspring save onedaughter only while from those who were not his queens he had manythis was a heavy grief to the pharaoh my father who saw in it thehands of the gods to whom he made great sacrifices especially toptahkhepera the creator and father of life building up his temple atmemphis and praying of him a son of the pure blood but no son cameand an oracle told him that he who loved the greeks so much must tothe greeks for offspring which was true for all his sons were bornof grecian women as perhaps the oracle knew alreadyon a certain day i and other lads of my age were running races afterthe grecian fashion in the long race i outran all the rest and fellpanting and exhausted into the arms of one who followed by threecompanions stood wrapped in a dark cloak for the time was winterjust by a wand that we had set in the ground to serve us as a winningpostwell run and well won said a voice which i knew for that of aprieshow are you named and who begot younow i rose from the ground upon which i had sunk and pretending thathe was a stranger to me gasped outramose is my name and as for that of my begetter go ask his ofpharaohi thought it muttered apries considering me then he turned to thefirst of his councillors and saidyou know of what we were talking just now this lad is straight andstrong and has a noble air moreover i have a good report of him fromhis instructors who say that he loves learning why should he not filla throne as well as another the double crown would look well upon hisbrowbecause his skin is too white pharaoh answered that councillorif the egyptians learned that you purposed to set a greek to rulethem after you they would cut his throat and perhaps tumble you intothe nilei remember these words very well because although spoken at hazardthey must have been inspired for they were in fact a prophecy seeingthat in the after years apries was tumbled into the nile whence amasiswho had usurped his throne rescued his body and gave it royal burialafter this pharaoh spoke to me for a while but not until he hadbidden one of his councillors to lift the cloak from his shoulders andthrow it round me lest i who was hot with the racing should takecold so there i stood wrapped in the royal cloak of tyrian purplewhile those kings companions muttered together thinking that thiswas an omen and that one day i should sit upon the throne yet it wasnone for it was not fated that any of the blood of uahabra orapries should reign after him that cloak i have to this day thoughi do not wear it because of its royal clasp for pharaoh does not takeback his gifts or even that which he has lent for an hour yes ihave the cloak but not the crown though this in truth i never soughtwell he searched me with his shrewd eyes that at times could look sofierce and asked me questions as to my studies also what i wished tobe a priest or a scribe or a soldierwhat pharaoh pleases i answered though if i had my will i wouldbe all three a priest because he draws nigh to the gods a scribebecause he gathers learning which is strength and a soldier becausehe defends his country and wins glory yet most of all i would be asoldierwell spoken said pharaoh like one who was astonished at my answeryou shall have your way if i can give it to youthen he held out his hand to me to kiss and left me mutteringwould that his mother had been egyptian and not greekhere i must tell that before this time my mother chloe who long agohad been succeeded by others in pharaohs favour no longer dwelt atthe court in sais for apries wishing to do well by her had givenher in marriage to a wealthy egyptian named tapert who was one of hisofficers at memphis where he filled the place of a judge and overseerof revenues this tapert a kindlyfaced grizzled little man hadfallen in love with my mothers beauty while he was at court makingreport to pharaoh on matters at memphis and especially as to therebuilding of the temple of ptah in that city with which he had todo noting this as he noted all when the time came for tapert toreturn to memphis apries asked him if he desired any gift of pharaohwhom he had served well tapert made no answer but let his eyes restupon my mother who with other women of the royal household sat at adistance broidering linen with grecian patterns as she loved to doapries thought a while then saidtake her if she will go for you are a good man if ugly and asyour wife she may be happier than hereas nothing ask her you havemy leaveso he asked as it was made easy for him to do and in the endalthough she loved the pomp and pleasures of the court my motherlistened to him knowing him for a very rich and honest man of goodblood and station one too whom she could rule so it came aboutthat while she was still a young and beautiful woman for the greeksdo not wither as early as do the egyptians by the permission ofpharaoh my mother was married according to the full custom to thecount tapert a man of many offices and titles who settled wealth uponher should he die thus it happened that she went to live with him atmemphis while i stayed behind at saisour parting was sad although after my childhood we had met butlittle because the laws of the court kept us aparthearken my son she said to me i make this marriage for a doublereason when i was but a child i was delivered into the hands ofpharaoh who soon forgot me in favour of others who came after butbecause i had borne him a son treated me honourably now while i amstill fair i have opportunity to leave this cage with golden bars andto become a free woman as the wife of a rich and honest man who lovesme one by whom i shall be cherished and i take it thankfully who ifi stayed here might one day find myself thrown into the street yetnot altogether for my own sake because it means that we must beparted also if i am loved i do not love know my son that what ido i do for you more even than for myself here in the palace you arehighly placed the pharaoh looks upon you with favour there are somewho think that in the end he will make a prince of you and having nolawful heirs of the royal blood name you to follow after him it maybe that this is in his mind but if so i am sure that it could nevercome about while your mother the grecian slave remained at court toremind the great ones of egypt that you are baseborn of a woman whosepeople the egyptians hate whereas if i go away this may be forgottenthough i fear that your skin will always tell its own storynor is this all as tapert has whispered to me pharaoh is richpharaoh is powerful and under him the people have prosperity the artsflourish and their gods are better served than they have been for manyan age all of which comes about because egypt is guarded by thegreeks whom pharaoh hires yet he says that they hate those guardiansthey who will not protect themselves and it may well happen that fromthis hatred trouble will come bringing with it the fall of pharaohand of those of his house therefore should that chance i would makeready a refuge for you my sontapert is very rich as he has told me one of the richest men inegypt although few know it and henceforth all he has is mine andwhat is mine is yours for i do not think that i shall ever bear himchildren therefore in the hour of trouble remember always that thereis a place where you can lay your head my son of the royal blood ofegypt whose throne you still may win by help of the wealth that i cangive you and thereby make me a grecian slave bought for her beautythe mother of a kingthus she spoke and as she did so i read her heart who although i wasso young had knowledge of the court ladies and their ways she wentbecause she thought it no longer safe to stay near to pharaoh who wasweary of the sight of her and of her importunities for gifts andhonours and might at any time cast her out still i was sad for iwho had no one else to love loved my mother however vain and foolishshe might beso she departed and became the wife of tapert pharaoh making manygifts to her but i stayed on at court and grew in strength andstature also in favour with pharaoh hence it came about that i wasadvanced beyond my station and made a count of egypt and a companionof the king with other offices and titles seeing which all men boweddown to me thinking that in days to come although i was basebornand half a greek i still might sit where pharaoh sat and so it mighthave chanced had it not been decreed otherwise and had not hathorwhom the greeks call aphrodite lit a flame of love within my heartthat burned me up and wellnigh brought me to my deathit happened thus the king of babylon had attacked certain peoples insyria of whom the chief king was named abibal an old man now in thefighting the babylonians were driven back or rather had retiredpurposing to return at their own season with a larger armyit mightbe next year or the year after or the year after that as it suitedthem to burn the cities of abibal and his allies and to slay theirpeoples or take them captivenow in this fighting the old king abibal was wounded with an arrow inthe thigh which wound festered so that in the end he died before hedied he determined to seek the aid of apries the pharaoh of egyptagainst the babylonians therefore since he trusted no one else heleft command that a young wife of his named atyra whom he had marriedin his age the daughter of another syrian king should go in personto the court of egypt and lay the cause of her country before pharaohso that he might send an army to defend it from the babylonians forthis old king cared nothing of what might happen to his young wifeafter he was dead or who should take her but for his people and theother peoples who were his allies he cared muchso he bound the queen atyra by a solemn oath to do his biddingcalling down the curse of his spirit and that of his gods upon her ifshe failed therein and she who was youthful and desired to see newlands and above all egypt swore all that he wished readily enoughafter which he died and was buried when he had been sealed up in histomb queen atyra a woman of great beauty who had been brought up instatecraft with a voice so sweet and a mind so subtle that she couldwin any man to her will started upon her journey in much pomp andbearing many gifts leaving her dead lords successor seated upon histhroneat length having passed all dangers and escaped from a troop of thebabylonians that was sent out to capture her she came safely to egyptand encamping at a little distance from sais despatched messengers topharaoh to announce her and ask his safeguard for herself and hercompanions as it chanced i ramose now a young man in my twentiethyear was the captain of the guard that day therefore it fell to meto receive these messengers and bring them before pharaoh and hisofficershe listened to their tale of which already he knew something from hisspies and those who served him in syria then having consulted withhis councillors and scribes he beckoned to me and when i came andbowed before him saidramose take an escort with you and ride out to the camp of this ladyatyra and say to her that it is too late for me to answer her prayertoday when the sun is already near to setting but that i willconsider of it tomorrow talk with her yourself if you can for shewill suspect no guile in one so young but at least spend the night ather camp learning all that you are able concerning her and herbusiness and tomorrow at the dawn return to make report to meso i went clad in the grecian armour that apries had commanded theguard to wear thereby giving much offence to the egyptian generalsand soldiers taking my newest cloak and mounted on a fine horse ofthe arab breed indeed having heard through the messengers that thislady was young and beautiful i desired to look my best for to tellthe truth like many youths of my age i was somewhat vain and wishedto please the eyes of women moreover this was not altogether strangeseeing that all thought me comely who was tall and wellshapedhaving clearcut grecian features that i inherited from my motherbrown hair that curled upon my head and large dark eyes the gift ofmy egyptian blood further i was ready of speech and could talk ofanything though in truth as yet i knew little all of which i do notshame to write now when i am old lastly i must add this though it isnot to my credit that i was too fond of women and made love to themwhen the chance came my way which was often at the court of sais orperhaps they made love to mei do not know at least none of them hadreally touched my heart or i theirsthus full of youth and goodliness and the lust of life and all thegifts that the gods give us when we are young of which we think solittle until we have grown old and they are gone followed by myescort i galloped forth proud of my mission and hoping for adventurefor little did i know that i rode into the arms of terror and ofsorrow                              chapter ii                          the cup of hathoran hour later guided by the messengers one of whom had gone on aheadto warn this lady atyra of my coming i caught sight of her camp setupon the sand at the edge of the cultivated land and noted that itwas large the tents were many dark in colour most of them for theywere woven of camel hair after the arab fashion but in their midstwas a great white pavilion dyed with stripes of blue and red overwhich fluttered a strange threepointed flag which seemed to beblazoned with stars of goldthis banner i guessed must mark the restingplace of the lady atyrawho called herself a queen what sort of a queen was she i wonderedthickmade and black probably though these syrians whom in myignorance i believed to be swarthy folk thought her fair as indeedall queens are fair according to those who serve themwhilst i was musing thus we came to the camp and must pass between twolines of camels many of which were lying down chewing their food nowlike most horses mine a spirited beast hated the sight and smell ofcamels and growing restive took the bit between its teeth in suchfashion that i could not hold it rushing forward it headed straightfor the great pavilion with the coloured stripes soldiers or servantssprang forward to stay the beast but without avail for it overthrewone of them causing the rest to fly on we went till at the very doorof the tent my horse caught its feet in a rope and fell hurling mestraight through the open entrance over and over i rolled and thoughmy bones were unharmed for the sand was covered with thick carpetsthe breath was shaken out of me so that for a while i sat gaspingwith my helmet all awry like to that of a drunken soldierthe sound of laughter reached me very gentle laughter that remindedme of water rippling over stones also there was other coarserlaughter such as might come from the throats of slaves or eunuchs orof servinggirls it made me very angry so much so that being halfstunned with what breath i had left i said words i should not haveuttered adding that i was pharaohs envoyand if so sir is this the fashion in which pharaohs envoys enterthe presence of those whom it pleases pharaoh to honour asked asilvery voice speaking in the grecian tongue though with a soft andforeign accentyes i answered if they set stinking camels to frighten theirhorses and lay ropes to snare their feetthen the blood went to my head and i suppose that i fainted for awhilewhen my sense returned i found myself stretched upon a couch and heardthat same voice giving orders both in greek and in the babylonian orchaldean tongue of which i knew something through the teaching of mytutor belus also in others that i did not know all of which talkconcerned myselftake that helm from his head said the soft voice though notsoftly o daughter of a fool can you not see that you are pressingthe edge of it upon the bruise away with you let me do it so nowremove the breastplatethat is easy for the straps have burstandopen the tunic to give him air what a white skin he has for anegyptian any woman would be proud of it by the gods he is a noblelooking youth and if he dies as he may for i think his neck istwisted those who tied the camels there and left the ropes lyingshall pay for it now wine where is the wine lift him gently andpour some down his throat nay not so would you drown the man handme the cup has that old leech been found if not bid him get himselfback to syria as best he mayjust then i opened my eyes to the lids of which leaden weights seemedto have been tied they met the glance of other eyes above me verybeautiful eyes that were neither blue nor black but something betweenthe two also i became aware that a white arm was supporting my headand that the fair and rounded breast of a very beautiful woman who waskneeling beside me touched my owni am the envoy of the pharaoh apries king of the two lands and ofthe countries beyond the sea the pharaoh says i began in feebletones repeating the lesson that i had learnednever mind what the pharaoh says answered she who leant over me ina rich low voice like most of his messages of which i have hadmany i doubt not that it will serve as well tomorrow as todaydrink this wine and lie quiet for a whilethat is if your neck isnot brokenso i drank and lay still thankful enough to do so for i had fallen onmy head and been much shaken having clung with my hands to the reinsof my horse as i had been taught to do in the military school insteadof stretching them out to protect myself the wine was good and warmedme also it seemed to clear my brain so that soon i was able to lookabout me and take notei saw that the pavilion in which i lay was finer than any that i hadever known being hung all round with beautiful mats or carpets thatshone like silk wherever the light fell upon them also there was atable at its end set with vessels of gold and silver and round itfolding stools made of ebony inlaid with ivory and piled withcushions and a brazier that stood upon a tripod for the desert airwas chill wherein burnt wood that gave out sweet odours moreoverthere were hanging lamps of silver that presently were lit by aswarthy eunuch for now night was closing in which burned with aclear white flame and like the fire gave out scentsthe eunuch clad in his rich apparel and headdress of twisted silkglanced at me out of his oblong eyes and went away leaving me alonein that perfumed place lying thus upon my soft cushioned bed astrange mood took hold of me as it does at times of those whosebrains reel under the weight of some heavy blow i seemed to lose allsense of time and place i seemed to be floating on a cloud above theearth looking backwards and forwards far away behind me was a wallor mass of blackness out of which i crawled a tiny naked child intothe light of day then came visions of my infancy little matters inmy life that i had long forgotten words that my mother had murmuredinto my baby ears her caresses when i was sick the softness of hercheek as she pressed it against my fevered brow and i know not whatbesides and all this while i the infant in her arms seemed to beasking this question of hermother whence came i and why am i hereto which she answered i do not know my child the gods will tellyouwhen you are deadthe stream of time flowed on yes it was a stream for i saw itflowing and on it i floated clutching day by day at sticks andstraws wherewith i built me a house of life as a bird builds itsnest till at last i saw myself falling from the horse and for amoment all grew dark then out of the darkness there appeared shadowyshapes some beautiful some terrible and i knew that these were thespirits of the future showing me their gifts they passed by and oncemore before me was a black wall such as that whence i had seemed tocome in the beginning which wall i knew was death i searched to findsome opening but could discover none i sank down outworn andterrified and lo as i sank there appeared a glorious gateway andbeyond it a city of many palaces and temples in whose courts walkedgods or men who looked like godsmy vision passed and i awoke wondering where that city might be andif within it i should find any habitationit was a foolish dream yet i set it down because i think it told mesomething of the mystery of birth and death or rather it set outthese mysteries revealing nothing for who knows what lies beyondthose black walls that are our alpha and omega and between which wespell out the alphabet of life also it was not altogether foolishfor even then i knew that the shapes of terror which seemed to waitupon my path were portents of advancing woeand trembled   it must have been the dead of night when i awoke thus out of my swoonfor now there was no sound in the camp save the tramping of thesentries and the howling of distant dogs or jackals smitten of themoon in the pavilion the scented lamps burned low or had been shadedso that the place was filled with a soft gloom in which shadowsseemed to move caused no doubt by the swinging of the lamps in thedraught of the night air yet one of these shadows the most palpableof them all did not move indeed it seemed to stand over me like aghost that waits the passing of one whom it has loved i grew afraidand stirred thinking to speak whereon the shadow turned its head sothat the light of the lamp fell upon the beautiful face of a womanwho are you i asked in a whisper for i seemed to fear to speakalouda sweet voice answeredo ramose pharaohs son and envoy i am your hostess atyra once aqueenand what do you here queen atyrai watch you my guest in your swoona poor task lady more fitting to a leech or slavei think not ramose son of the king as i have been told that youare by your escort and others there is much to be learned from thosewho sleep by one who has the gift of reading soulsis it your gift ladyi have been taught it by wise men in syria magi the persians callthem and as i think not quite in vain at least i have read yoursoulthen lady you have read that which is worth nothing for what iswritten upon so short a scrollmuch count ramose for our life is like the chapters of a book andalready at our birth fate has stamped the titles of those chaptersupon its clay leaving it to time to write the rest your story ithink will be long if sad in part yet it was not to talk of suchthings that i have come here alone at nightwhy then did you come ladyfirst to see how you fared for your fall was heavy and secondly ifyou were well enough to hear your messageit is short lady pharaoh bids me say that he will answer yourrequests tomorrow since today it is too lateyet it was not too late for him to send you count ramose chargedwith words that mean nothing i will tell you why he sent you it wasto spy upon me and make report to himthus she said resting her chin upon her hand and looking at me withher great dark eyes which shone in the lamplight like to those of anightbird but i remained silentyou do not answer o ramose because you cannot well your office iseasy for i will tell you all there is to learn the old king abibalwhose wife i was in name is dead and dying left a charge upon metosave his country from the babylonians calling down the curse of allthe gods upon my head in life and on my soul in death should i failby my own fault to fulfil his dying prayer therefore i have come toegypt although the oracles warned me against this journey for thecase of these syrians is very hard and desperate and in egypt liestheir only hope who alone cannot stand against the might of babylontell me son of the king will apries help usi do not know lady i answered but i do know that least of allthings does he or egypt desire a war against babylon you must pleadyour own cause with him i cannot answer your questionhow can i plead my cause count ramose i bring great gifts of goldand silks and spices but what are these to him who holds the wealthof egypt i can promise allegiance and service but my people are faraway and egypt seeks no war in which they can be usedagain i answered that i did not know then addedyet your nation could have found no better envoy for pharaoh loves abeautiful womando you think me beautiful she asked softly well to tell truthso have others though as yet such favour as i have has brought melittle joy and she sighed adding slowly of what use is beautyto her who has found none to lovei know little of such things lady yet perhaps for you the searchis not finishedshe looked at me a while before she answeredmy heart tells me that you are right o ramose the search is notfinishedthen she rose and taking a cup of wine gave me to drink of itafterwards drinking a little herself as though to pledge methis done she poured the rest of the wine upon the ground like toone who makes an offering before some god bent down so close that herscented breath beat upon my brow whispered to me to sleep well andglided awayi think there must have been some medicine in that wine for presentlyall the pain left my head and neck and i fell fast asleep yet not sofast but that through the long hours i seemed to dream of theloveliness of this syrian queen until at length i was awakened by thesunlight shining in my eyesa servant who must have been watching me noted this and went away asthough to call some one then an old man came one with a white beardwho wore a strangeshaped capgreeting sir he said in bad greek as you may guess i am thecourt physician most unhappily i was absent last night seeking forcertain plants that are said to grow in egypt which must be gatheredby the light of the moon since otherwise they lose their virtueindeed i returned but an hour agois it so physician i answered well i trust that you found yourherbsyes young sir i found them in plenty and gathered them with theappropriate spells yet i would i had never learned their name for ihear that my mistress is very wrath with me because i was not presentwhen you chanced to roll into the tent like a stone thrown from acatapult and may the gods help him with whom she is wrath still isee that you live who i was told had a broken neck now let me seewhat harm you have taken if anythen he called to the eunuch to come within the screens that had beenset round me and strip me naked when this was done he examined mewith care setting his ear against my breast and back and feeling meall over with his handsby bel or whatever god you worship he said you have a fineshape young lord one well fitted for waror love nor can i findthat there is aught amiss with you save a bruise upon your shoulderand a lump at the back of your head no bone is broken that i willswear stand up now and let me treat you with my ointmentsi stood up to find myself little the worse save for a dizziness whichsoon passed away and was rubbed with his aromatics and afterwardswashed and clothed then i was led out of the pavilion to where my menwere camped who rejoiced to see me living and sound for a rumour hadreached them that i was dead with them i ate and a while later wassummoned to the presence of the queen atyraso once more i entered the pavilion to find this royal lady seated ina chair made of sycamore wood inlaid with ivory i bowed to her andshe bowed back to me giving no sign that she had ever seen me beforeindeed she looked at me with her large eyes as though i were astranger to her and i looked at her clad in her rich robes over whichflowed her black abundant hair and marvelled at her beauty for itwas great and moved mei will not set out all our talk indeed after these many years much ofit is forgotten though that which we held at midnight i rememberwell when we were but man and woman together and not as now anenvoy and a foreign queen discussing formal matters of state the sumof it was that she grieved to hear of my mischance and prayed me toaccept a stallion of the syrian breed in place of my own which hadbeen lamed through the carelessness of her servants but rejoiced toknow from her physician that beyond a blow which stunned me for awhile i had taken little harmi thanked her and delivered pharaohs message at which she smiled andsaid that it told her nothing except that she must wait where shewas until it pleased him to send another meanwhile she hoped that iwould be her guest as the physician told her i was not yet fit toridenow as this plan pleased me well for to tell truth i longed for moreof the company of that most lovely woman i summoned the scribe whowas amongst those who rode with me and wrote a letter to pharaohtelling him of what had chanced which letter i despatched in chargeof two of my guard they departed and at evening returned againbringing an answer signed by pharaohs private scribe which bade mestay till i was able to travel and then accompany the queen atyra tothe courtso there i remained that night being given a tent to sleep in near tothe pavilion in the evening also i was bidden to eat with the queenand certain of her councillors when as she alone knew the greciantongue the talk lay between her and me indeed as soon as the mealwas finished she made some sign whereat these men rose and went awayleaving us alonethe night was very hot so hot that presently she saidcome my young guest if it pleases you let us leave this tentedoven and walk a while beneath the moon breathing the desert air noneed to call your guard for here you are as safe as though you sat inpharaohs palacei answered that it pleased me well and calling for two of her womento accompany us we set forth the queen wearing a hooded silkencloak that the women brought to her which covered her white shape andglittering jewels like a veil i too was wrapped in a cloak since iwore no armour and thus we thought the pair of us passed unnotedthrough the campat a distance on the crest of a sandy hill stood the ruin of some oldtemple overlooking the cultivated land and the broad waters of thenile thither we wended followed by the two women at least at firstwe were followed by them but later when i looked i could not see themany more still of this i said nothing who was well content to bealone with this gracious and beautiful lady we came to the temple andentered its hoary courts whence a jackal fled away as did anightbird perched upon a cornice telling me that here there was noman at the far end of the court there remained a statue of hathorone of a pair for the other had fallen that it was hathor mighteasily be known for she wore the vulture cap and above it hornsbetween which rested the disc of the moon near to the feet of thisstatue in the shadow of a wall atyra sat herself down upon a brokenblock of alabaster motioning to me to place myself at her sidewhat goddess is this she asked who carries the horns of a beastupon the brow of a fair womanhathor goddess of love i answered whom some call mistress of thegodsis it so well by this title or by that she is known in every landand well is she named mistress of the gods and men strange thatamidst all this ruin she alone should have stood through the longcenturies an emblem of love that does not die how beautiful is thenight see the great moon riding in yonder cloudless sky look at herrays glittering on the rivers face and hark to the breeze whisperingamong the palms beneath truly such a night should be dear to hathorso dear thathere she broke off her dreamy talk then said suddenlytell me of yourself prince ramosedo not give me that title i exclaimed if it were heard it mightbring trouble on me who am but a count of egypt by pharaohs graceyet it is yours ramose she answered and in this place there isnone to hear save hathor and the moon now speakso i told her my short tale to which she listened as though it hadbeen that of the deeds of a king then saidbut you have left out the half of it all you have left out hathori do not understand i answered looking down to hide my blushesi mean that you have left out love tell me of those whom you haveloved do you not know that it is of love that all women wish most toheari cannot lady for i havenever lovedif that be true how deep a cup of love is left for you to drinkwhose lips have not yet sipped its wine ramose so here in the shadowof hathor sit a pair of us for to give you truth for truth i tellyou that though i am your elder i too have never lovedyet you are a widow i said astonishedaye the widow of an aged man who married me because of my birth mywit my wealth and the great friends i brought him and whom imarried to serve my people that were threatened as his are today bythe giant might of babylon abibal was to me a father and no more ifa beloved father whose commands i will execute to the death whichcommands bring me upon a long and perilous journey to seek help frommighty pharaoh who desires to give me nonenow i glanced at her sideways and saidyou are very beauteous lady you have the eyes of a dove the stepof a deer the wisdom of a man and the grace of a palm were therethen none who pleased your eyes about your court in syriawhile my lord lived i was blind as became a loyal wife sheansweredand now that he is dead ladyoh now i cannot say no more do i seek a husband who am a queen andwould remain free the slave of no one for what slavery is there liketo that of marriage yet it is true that i desire love if i maychoose that love come let us be going for yonder egyptian hathor ofyours casts her spell over me and brings thoughts that for long i haveforbidden in my heart i think that this is an evilomened place itsgoddess tells of love but its hoar ruins tell of death doubtless didwe but know it here we sit above the shrouded dead who staring at usfrom their sepulchres mock our beating hearts which soon will be asstill as theirs come let us be going who yet are young and freefrom the webs of hathor and of death death i defy thee while i mayhathor i make a mock of thee and thy calm compelling gaze dost thounot also make a mock of hathor ramose and turning she looked at mewith her great eyes that seemed to glow in the shadows like to thoseof an owli do not know i answered faintly for those eyes drew the strengthout of me yet it is dangerous to mock at any goddess and most ofall at hathor still let us go i think it very wise that we shouldgo the scent of your hair overwhelms me who have been ill my brainrocks like a boat upon the sea hathor has me by the handyes i think that hathor has us both by the heart she answered inher low rich voice a voice of honeythen our lips met for there in her temple we had drunk of hathorscup                             chapter iii                         the counsel of beluswe rose her face was like the dawn her eyes were dewy but itrembled like a leaf i whose heart for the first time love hadgripped with cruel handsi thought i saw a shadow flit across a pool of moonlight that laywithin the temples broken pylon the shadow of a manwhat frightens you she askedi told her in a whisperperchance it was a spirit of which this place must be full for suchthey say look like shadows or perchance it was thrown from the broadwings of some fowl of the night she answered lightly at least ifit be otherwise that watcher was too far away to have seen us hereseated side by side in gloom certainly he could not have heard ourwords yet ramose hathors gift to me i would warn you among thosewho sat with us at the board tonight did you take note of one abearded man of middle age hooknosed with flashing eyes like tothose of a hawkyes lady atyra and i thought that he looked askance at meit may be so listen that man was a councillor of abibals a priestof his god also and as such one of great power in the land always hehas pursued me with his love and now he would wed me but i hate himas hitherto i have hated all men and will have none of himmoreover here her voice grew hard and cold when i am strong enoughi will be rid of him but that is not yet if i can win pharaohsfriendship and bring it to pass that he names me to succeed to thethrone of abibal as his subject queen then and not till then shall ibe strong enough for this ninari has a large following and the halfof my escort are sworn to him meanwhile have no fear and be surethat in this our first kiss i pledged my heart to you and to noother mani thank you o most beautiful i answered yet tell me lady howcan this matter end you have been a queen and will be one againwhile i am but pharaohs baseborn son one of many though i thinkthat he loves me best of all of them also i am young and unprovedwhat then can there be between useverything before all is done i think ramose if you will but trustto me who am wise and strong in my fashion and being alas older thanyou are have seen and learned more already i have a plan i willpersuade pharaoh to send you with me to syria there to be his eyesand envoy and once back in my own country i will be rid of thisninari and will take you as my husband saying that such is pharaohswillmay that day come soon i muttered who already was as full of loveof this royal woman as a drunkard is with winemeanwhile we had left the temple and were walking side by side butnot too near down the slope of sand towards the camp as we wentfrom a clump of stunted sycamores appeared the two waitingladies whomatyra chided because they had not followed her more closelythey answered that they had seen a man who looked like a thief of thedesert watching them and being afraid had taken refuge among thetrees till he went away down towards the river then they had come outbut could not find us and therefore returned to the trees and waitednot knowing what else to doyou should have run back to the camp and fetched a guard sheanswered angrily for is it meet that the lady atyra should wanderunaccompanied in the nightthen she dismissed them and they fell behind us but although i wasyoung and knew little of womens tricks the only thing i believedabout that tale was that they had seen a man perchance the samewhose shadow flitted across the moonlight within the broken pylonwhen we reached the camp and had passed the sentries in front of thepavilion we met the councillor and priest ninari who seemed to bewaiting there doubtless for our return he bowed low and spoke to thequeen in a syrian tongue which i did not understand and in thattongue she answered him somewhat sharply as i thought again hebowed low almost to the ground indeed but all the while i felt thathis fierce eyes were fixed upon me then with some courteous words tomyself thanking me for my company she passed into the pavilioni too turned to go to my own quarters where my escort awaited mewhen this ninari stepped in front of me and said in bad and gutturalgreekyoung lord from the pharaohs court your pardon but i would haveyou know that whatever may be the fashions of egypt it is not ourcustom for strangers to walk alone with a great lady at nightespecially if she chances to be our queennow there was something in the mans voice and manner which stirred myblood and i answered holding my head highsir i am a guest here and pharaohs envoy and i go where my hostessasks me to go whatever may be your syrian customsyou are strangely favoured he said sneering your horse which youcannot manage hurls you like a sack stuffed with barley into thepresence of our mistress she doctors your bruised poll and now takesyou out walking in the moonlight well well i should remember thatyou are but a forward crossbred egyptian boy welllooking enough asbastards of your kind often are in their youth just such a one as itpleases grown women to play with for an hour and then cast asidei listened to this string of insults welling like venom from the blackheart of the jealous syrian at first they amazed me to whom no suchwords had ever been used before then as the meaning of his coarsetaunts hissed out in broken greek came home to me being no coward igrew enrageddog i said beast of a syrian do you dare to talk thus topharaohs envoy a count of egypt and lifting my arm i who was atrained boxer doubled my fist and smote him in the face with all mystrength so that he went headlong to the groundat the sound of my raised voice men ran together from here and theresome of them those of my own escort whose tents were near at handsome of them syriansand stood staring as this ninari went backwardto the earth in a moment he was up again blood pouring from hishooked nose and came at me a curved and naked blade in his handwhich i suppose he had drawn as he rose seeing this i too drew myshort grecian sword and faced him though there was this differencebetween us that whereas i had no armour being clothed only in afestal dress of linen he wore a coat of syrian mail my men notingthis would have thrown themselves between us but i shouted to themto stand aside the syrians would have done likewise but at somecommand that i did not hear they also fell back thus we were leftfacing each other in the full moonlight which was almost as clear asthat of dayninari smote at me with his broad curved blade i bent almost to myknee and the blow went over my head rising i thrust back my swordpoint struck him full beneath the breast but could not pierce his goodarmour though it caused him to reel and stumble again he came at mesmiting lower to catch me on the body which he knew was unprotectedand this time i must leap far backwards so that the point of hisblade did no more than cut through my linen garment and just scratchthe skin beneathyet that scratch stung me more perhaps than a deeper wound would havedone and made me mad uttering some old greek warcry as i think onemy mother had taught me as that of her fathers house i flew at theman and smote him full upon his helm shearing off one side of it andcausing him to stagger before he could recover himself i smote againand though the steel glanced from the edge of his severed helm yetpassing downwards it cut off his right ear and sank deep into hisneck and shoulderhe fell and lay there as it was thought dead the syrians began tomurmur for they did not love to see a noted warrior of their race thusdefeated by an unarmoured youth my men fearing trouble ringed meround muttering such words aswell done young ramose you have lopped that curs ear countalthough he wore a collar when you had none now if any other syrianwould like a turn and so forth for this escort of mine some ofthem greek and some egyptian were all picked fighters of pharaohsguard and rejoiced that their boy officer should have won in souneven a fraythe business grew dangerous the friends of ninari drew their weaponsand waved spears my escort made a ring about me in the grecianfashion their swords stretched out in front of them then i heard awomans voice cryhave done fools would you bring pharaohs wrath upon us and causeour countrys prayer to him to be refused if this young egyptian lordhas done ill let pharaoh judge himqueen i broke in panting between my words i have done no illthis follower of yours and i pointed to ninari who lay upon the sandgroaning for no cause bespattered me with the vile mud of insultstill at length unable to bear more i felled him with my hand he roseand although i wear no mail sprang at me to slay me with his swordso i must defend myself as best i might there are many here who canbear witness that i speak the truthit is needless count ramose she answered in a clear voice forknow that i heard and saw something of this business and hold that youwere scarcely to blame save that you should have taken no heed of mador winebred talk yet lest harm should come to you and i and mypeople be put to shame i pray you leave this camp now at once andreturn to sais whither i will follow you tomorrow to seek audience ofpharaoh and ask his pardon let the horses of pharaohs envoy be madereadymen ran to do her bidding but my guard who looked doubtfully at thesyrians remained about me save two of them who went to my tent andthence brought my armour which they helped me to gird onmeanwhile that same old leech who had tended me had been busy withninari whom he ordered to be carried to his tent now he rose and madehis report to atyrathe lord ninari henceforth must go oneeared he said also theegyptians sword has cut through his mail and sunk into the flesh ofhis shoulder for the blow was mighty yet by chance it seemed to havemissed the big vein of the neck so unless his hurts corrupt i thinkthat he will livei pray the gods it may be so answered atyra in a cold voice andthat henceforth his tongue may remember what has chanced to his earhear me all if any lifts a hand against pharaohs envoy or hiscompany because of this matter he dies farewell count ramose tillwe meet again at sais and with one flashing glance of her greateyes she turned and went followed by her womena while later i and my guard rode out of the camp i mounted upon thedesertbred stallion that the queen had given me in place of my ownbeast which was lamed the syrians watched us go in silence exceptone fellow who cried outyou won that fight young cock of egypt but it will bring you nogood luck who have cropped the ear of the priest ninari and earned thecurse of his godi made no answer but presently when we were clear of the camp andriding alone in the moonlight i began to think to myself that thisvisit of mine had been strange and illomened it began with the fallof my horse which hurled me as ninari had said like a sack ofbarley into the presence of her to whom i was sent a mischance whicheven to this day i cannot remember without shame then came thosehours when i lay halfswooning and in pain and woke to find that mostbeautiful queen watching me alone which in egypt we should havethought strange though mayhap the syrians and the desertdwellers hadeasier customs at last she spoke and told me that she had come thusto read my soul while i slept why should she wish to read the soul ofone who was unknown to her until that daynow i bethought me of what had passed between us afterwards in theruined temple and an answer rose in my mind it must be because atfirst sight of my face this lady had been smitten with love of me asi had heard sometimes chances to women and to men also could i doubtit with her kiss still burning on my lips and yet who knewit mightbe that she did but play a part to serve her secret ends which causedher to put out her womans strength and make me her slave why notthis love of hers if love it were had been most swift was it to bebelieved that she my elder by some years would suddenly becomeenamoured of a lad was it not easy as indeed i knew for a woman tofeign passion was it not done every day on the street or elsewherewhat did a few kisses matter to such a one was i more than a youngfool beguiled and for this beguilement was there not good reason iwas pharaohs son whom he was known to favour in his fashion because iwas welllooking quick and in a way learned also i was his envoyone whose report he would accept further this great syrian ladydesired pharaohs help what more natural then than that she shouldstrive to win that favoured son and envoy to her interests and howcould she bind him better to her than with her lips and wanton hairso this was the sum of it that i knew not whether i were but apainted plaything or the jewel on her breast all i knew alas wasthat she had taken my heart into those soft white hands of hers andthat passion for her burned me uptruly it was an evil business and to make it worse i had quarrelledwith and hewn off the ear of that jealoushearted foultonguedpriestminister of hers who doubtless hoped to wed her and thus win athrone oh truly this had been an accursed journey from which no goodcould come as that shouter of a syrian had foretold and yetandyet i was glad to have made it for atyras kisses burned upon mylips and i longed for more of them when she came to saiswe reached the palace before the dawn and i went to my chamber andslept for after all that had chanced to me this night i was veryweary also there was time since none might appear before pharaohuntil within two hours of midday after he had made his offerings tothe god and rested when at length i awoke the first thing that myeyes fell upon was the brown wrinkled face of my master and friendthe learned babylonian belusgreeting ramose he said i heard that you were returned and asyou did not come to me i have come to you they are telling strangestories in the courtyards of your adventures yonder in the desertstories that are little to your credit as an envoy although theypraise you as a man at least i hear that your escort speak well ofyour swordsmanship now out with these tales for they will go nofurther than my ears and for the rest perhaps i can give you goodcounselso because we loved each other i told him everything from thebeginning to the end he listened then saidwhen i entered this chamber ramose i smelt two things the scent ofa womans hair and the reek of a mans blood which was natural as youhave neither bathed your face nor cleaned your sword or perhaps thespirit that is in me did this it does not matter now what haschanced to you was to be expected seeing that you are young and wellfavoured one of a kind that women will seek out as butterflies seekthe nectar that they love in the throats of certain infrequentflowers one too whose hand is shaped to a swordhilt so the womanhas come and the sword has swung aloft and now follows the troublehe paused a while in thought then went onas you know ramose in the time that i have to spare from thewriting of letters to babylon and work or learning of the useful sorti follow after divination according to our babylonian methods by thehelp of stars and the shadows that these throw in crystals or inwater a foolish and uncertain art yet one through which now andagain peeps the cold eye of truth last night at least it told mesomething namely that you would do well to take a journey bypharaohs leave say to memphis to see your mother until this halfqueen atyra has finished her business at the court and returned tosyriai do not wish to leave the court at present belus i answeredawkwardlyah i guessed as much they say that though past her youth thissyrian woman is very fair and doubtless those experienced eyes of hershave pierced to your heart and set it afire yet i pray you to go tillshe has departed back to syriayou speak earnestly belus tell me what else did the starlight showyou in your crystalthat which i liked little sonmuch and yet nothing that lightturned to bloodwhose blood i do not know yet in the red mist i sawshapes moving and one of them wasyours ramosenow i grew afraid and that i might find time to think bade him speakonhearken son you have tasted a wine that some men desire more thanany other and you would drain the cup yet the dregs of thispassionate drink from natures ancient cup are always bitter and oftendeadly or charged with shame you would make that woman yours andperchance if she does not play with you you may succeed for i thinkthat she too found the potion sweet yet i say that if so it will beto your sorrow and herswhy should i not love her i broke in she is beautiful and wiseshe is unwed though she be older than i am i would make her my wifeand share her fortunes may not a man take a wife who pleases him andwhom he pleasesa man may if he is foolish answered belus with his quiet smilebut what is mere unwisdom for a man for a lad is often madnessmoreover this lady lies like a bait in a snarenet full of policieshigh policies that you do not understand to meddle with her may bringabout a war with babylon or perchance may throw the peoples whosecause she is here to plead into the arms of babylon and thus openegypts flank to egypts foes if either of these troubles happeneddo you think you would earn pharaohs thanks i say that he wouldcurse you and cast you forth perhaps over the edge of the world intodeaths darknessindeed already one of them has begun because of her you have foughtwith a priest of her gods that are not your gods or those of egypt oreven of the greeks black gods and bloody you have cut him down andmaimed him even if he is not slain do you hold that this priest andcounsellor will suffer those gods or their worshippers to forget suchan outrage against their minister will he not lay that severed ear ofhis upon their altar and cry to them for vengeance already it seemsthe syrians muttered curses on you as you rode away and if they cometo learn that you an alien of another faith are the favoured loverof their lady the widow of their king through whom since he has leftno children perchance one of them hopes to win his throne what thenlastly i warn you that this business may end in terrors or rather ipass on the warning that my spirit gives me i pray you ramose toheed my counsel let me go to pharaoh and ask of him to send you hencetill this embassy is finished indeed i would that i had gone alreadyas soon as i learned your talethus he spoke and watching him i noted that he was much in earnestfor his face had flushed and his hands quivered now although myflesh rebelled for i yearned to see atyra again more than ever i hadyearned for anything my reason bent itself before the will of thismaster of mine whom i loved and who as i knew loved me i wouldaccept his decree as though it were that of an oracle if pharaohpermitted i would go to memphis or elsewhere and if i must find asweetheart she should be one of a humbler sort upon whose favourshung no great matters of the state yet having as it seemed madeconquest of so lovely and highplaced a lady a victory of which i wasproud indeed it was very hard to leave her without reason given orfarewell still it should be donepresentlybelus i said wait a little while i bathe myself and change mygarments and eat a mouthful of food i think that i will do as youwish but you ask much of me and i would have a space in which tothink be pleased therefore dear belus to grant it to mehe studied me with his bright and kindly eyes then answeredtake what you wish for well i know the vanity of youth and that if ideny your will it may turn you against my counsel i will waitthough in this matter i hold that delay is folly be swift now forwith every minute that passes danger draws more nearso i withdrew and the black slaves who were my servants for in allways at the palace i was treated as a great lord and even as a princebathed me and clothed me in fresh garments and dressed my hair whilethey did so i ate a little and drank a cup of wine that was brought tome these things done i went into the anteroom where belus walked toand fro with bowed headwhat word he askedmaster i answered i have taken counsel with myself and though itcosts me dear i bow to your will knowing that you are wise while iam but a lad and full of folly go to pharaoh lay all this matterbefore him giving it your own colour then if having heard hethinks it well that i should depart i will do so at once and see thequeen atyra no more though thus i earn her scorn or even her hatewell spoken son he answered though i would that you had beenless stubborn and had found those words an hour ago still suchsacrifice is hard to the young and i forgive you now bide you herewhile i wait on pharaoh in his private chamber to which i have entryas one whom he consults upon many secret matters also on those of hishealth presently i will return with his commandsas the words left his lips the curtains at the far end of the chamberopened and through them came a messenger clad in the royal liverywho bowed to me and saidkings son and count ramose pharaoh commands your presence now atoncei obey i answered but belus at my side groaned and mutteredall is spoilt too late too late                              chapter iv                          the fall of ramosei was led to pharaohs private chamber belus coming with me here ifound him in a troubled and a wrathful mood and guessed from his faceand those of certain who waited on him among them amasis the generalhe who was afterwards destined to become pharaoh that there was eviltidings in the wind here i should write that this amasis a finelooking man though of no high birth and a great soldier was a friendto me to whom he had taken a fancy while i was still quite a boy itwas under his command that i had learned all i knew of matters whichhave to do with war the handling of weapons and the leading of menhow shall we act pharaoh was saying to amasis there can be nodoubt that the king of babylon intends to threaten if not to attackegypt now that he has finished with those hebrews moreover it is thematter of the syrian tribes over whom abibal was king that has broughtthe business to a head nebuchadnezzar or whoever holds the realpower in babylon now that he is sunk in age has heard of the embassyof the queen atyra to me and purposes to be beforehand with usfearing lest we should aid the syrians that is why he sends an armyagainst egypti hold that it is but a feint pharaoh answered amasis for as yetthe babylonians have not strength upon the frontier for so vast anenterprise the best plan is to be bold do you send me with anotherarmy to guard our borders and meanwhile speak this queen fair lestsuddenly she or her syrians should turn round make peace withbabylon and join in the onslaught then the danger would be greatbecause those syrian tribes are countlessgood counsel or so i think said pharaoh do you set aboutgathering troops friend amasis and make all things ready but asquietly as may beat this moment his eye fell upon me and he saidso you are back son ramose now tell me what is all this tale i hearabout you first it seems you tumble off your horse and make yourselfa laughingstock to the syrians and next you quarrel with one ofthem a dangerous fellow and a priest called ninari of whom i haveheard before and crop him of an ear i am angry with you what haveyou to sayonly this pharaoh i answered it was my horse that tumbled over arope not i and for the rest the syrian insulted me using words thatyou would not have wished your son to suffer no nor any gentleman ofegyptwhy did he insult you ramose had you perchance drunk too much ofthat strong syrian winenot so pharaoh it was because at her own request i had led thequeen atyra to the ruined temple above her camp that thence she mightlook on the river by moonlight this i did because pharaoh bade me towin the friendship of the queen and learn all i could of her mindindeed ramose and did you perchance learn anything else of herletus say that her eyes were bright or her lips softnow the blood came to my face while amasis laughed in his roughfashion and even pharaoh smiled a little as he went onwell if you did you will not tell me so to ask is useless listeni know thisfor when i sent you on that business i sent others tokeep a watch on youi say i know that this lady found you to hertaste or made pretence to do so for her own ends therefore ioverlook your foolishness and purpose to make use of you presentlyshe will be at the palace i appoint you the officer in attendance onher with command to draw from her all you can and report what youlearn to me for now that i do not trust this woman who perchance isafter all but a spy of babylon do you hear mei hear pharaoh i answered bowing low to hide the doubt and troublein my eyesthen understand this also that i put a great trust upon you ramoseplay the lover if you like but remember that your first duty is toplay the spy above all no more quarrels with ninari or any other donothing foolish speak warm words but let your heart stay cold nowopportunity is in your hand and if you fail me it will be for thelast time aye your life may hang on itspare me this task pharaoh i muttered for it is one that mayprove too hard for me give it to another an older man likelikebeluspharaoh looked at belus who although not very old already was baldand withered like to an ancient papyrus that for centuries has beenburied in the sand he was coldeyed also and one who shrank away fromwomen as though they were smitten by a plague a man from whom wisdomand learning seemed to ooze but whose history heart and ends werehidden somewhat sinister withal save to the few he loved perhapsfrom long acquaintance with dark secrets whispered by spirits in thenight yes pharaoh looked at him and laughedthe learned belus has his uses he said as all know when they aresmitten in body or in soul but i do not think that the cozening offair women is one of them each to his trade and part but ramosebeware lest you betray the one and overdo the other take but givenothing and above everything be friends with all even with thisninari if he lives praying his pardon and salving his hurt withgiftsthen he waved his hand to dismiss me and once more fell into talk withthe general amasisi prostrated myself and went followed by belus my tutor who whenwe had reached my quarters sat himself down upon the floor like amourner and wiped his brow sayingunless you are wiser than i think son ramose all is finished andyou are losti stared at him in question and he went ondo you not understand that pharaoh has set you a terrible task youthe hungry bee must hover over the open flower but not taste itsnectar you the dazzled moth must wheel round the flame but notscorch your wings you the young and ardent must play the part ofthe aged and the cold moreover this he has done of deep purpose totry your quality and to learn whether duty can conquer passion ithink that if you prevail in this matter he means to lift you higheven to the footsteps of the throne but if you fail why thenfarewell to youi shall not fail i answered wearily for my honour is on it nowlet me rest a while i have been hurt i have gone through much andfor two nights i have had little sleep also i have fought for mylifethen without more words i threw myself down upon my bed and soonforgot all things even atyrawhen i awoke it was already late afternoon so late that scarcely wasthere time before night fell for me to visit the chambers of thepalace where the queen atyra and her servants were to lodge and giveorders for their preparation as now i had authority to do thesechambers as it chanced whether by design or by accident adjoined myown for i dwelt in some small rooms of that wing of the great palacethat was used to house pharaohs guests therefore i had not far togo only the length of a short passage indeed and through a door ofwhich i held the keyuntil it was dark and next morning from the sunrise aided bychamberlains and other palace servants i laboured at this makingready all was clean all was garnished everywhere flowers were setbeautiful curtains were hung up vessels of gold and silver fit for aqueens use were provided the garden ground that lay in the centre ofthis wing of the palace having in it a little lake filled with lotusflowers was tended so that if she pleased the queen atyra might sitthere beneath the shadow of palms and flowering trees the eunuchswere furnished with fresh robes and i know not what besidesat length when all was prepared i looked out from an upper window andsaw the cavalcade of the syrians drawing near to the palace in itscentre preceded and followed by whiterobed turbaned men mountedupon camels was a splendid litter which doubtless held the queen forit was surrounded by a guard of horsemen also there were otherlitters for her women while last of all came one like that on whichthe sick are borne whereof the bearers stepped very carefully that iguessed hid none other than the priest ninari who to tell truth ihoped had gone to the bosom of osiris or of whatever god heworshipped belus who was by me read as much in my eyes and shook hishead sayingsnakes are very hard to kill my son as i who have hunted one foryears know as well as any man and better than most be careful lestthis one should live to bite youthen i hurried away to be arrayed in the festal robes of a count ofegypt and to put about my neck the gold chain that marked my rank asthe son of a king scarcely was i prepared when a messenger summonedme to the great hall of audience thither i went to find pharaohgloriously attired wearing the double crown with the gold earringsand other ornaments of state and holding in his hand a sceptre roundabout him were the great officers of the court at his feet crouchedscribes while just behind the fanbearers stood his generals someegyptian and some greek all clad in armour amongst whom i notedamasisi advanced followed by belus my tutor and prostrated myself beforethe throne pharaoh bade me rise and with his sceptre pointed to wherei should stand among or rather a little in front of the nobles andkings sons of whom there were several my halfbrothers born ofdifferent ladies though i was the eldest of them as i went steppingbackwards and bowing at each step pharaoh turned and spoke to amasisand i think his words were that i was a young man of whom any kingmight be proud to be the fatheryes answered amasis in a hoarse whisper that reached me yet it ispity that he is so like to one of those statues that the greeks ofwhom you are so fond fashion of their gods his mother has too muchshare in him pharaoh look at his curly headthen they both laughed and i nearly fell in my confusionat this moment trumpets blew heralds cried aloud and preceded byofficers with white wands the queen atyra appeared between thepillars at the end of the hall of audience on her head she wore aglittering crown jewels shone upon her breast pearls were twisted inher looped and raven locks and round her white wrists while hersilken train was borne by fair waitingwomen oh seen thus she wasbeautiful so beautiful that as i watched her tall imperial shapeglide up that hall like a sunbeam through its shadows my heart stoodstill and my lips burned with the memory of her kiss a little sigh ofwonder went up from the courtiers and through it i heard the jestingamasis whisper once morei wish that you had given me ramoses office pharaoh to whichapries answerednay you are too rough you would frighten this syrian dove whereashe will stroke her feathersdove dove muttered amasisthen pharaoh lifted his sceptre and there was silenceatyra drew near in all her scented beauty with bent head and downcasteyes yet for one instant those dark eyes were lifted and i feltrather than saw them flash a look upon me saw also the red lipstremble as though with a little smile i think that belus saw alsofor i heard a groan come from where he stood near by in attendance onme the queen mounted the royal dais and curtseyed low thoughprostrate herself she did not because she was a majesty greeting amajesty pharaoh descended from his throne and taking her hand ledher to a seat that was placed near though slightly lower than thisthronethen she spokein greek which by now had become the courtly languageamong many nations that did not know each others speech aninterpreter began to render her words but apries waving him asideanswered her in the same tongue which he knew as well as he did hisown having learned it from my mother and others this caused many ofthe egyptians round him to frown especially those that were old orwedded to ancient ways which had come down to them through thousandsof years who hated the greeks with their new fashions their languageand all that had to do with them indeed i noted that even amasisfrowned and shrugged his shoulders and that the other egyptiangenerals looked on him with approval as he did soas for the talk between atyra and pharaoh it need not be set out shemade a formal prayer to him reminding him of the ancient friendshipbetween the syrians and egypt that more than once during thegenerations which had gone by had been their overlord yes from thetime of the great thotmes onward though sometimes they had quarrelledas a wife will even with the husband whom she loves now she thewidow of abibal who had been the head king of the syrian peoples andwho had died leaving his mantle upon her shoulders came to seekrenewal of that alliance even though syria must thus once more becomethe wife of egypt and serve as a wife serveshere pharaoh asked shrewdly if this wife sought to shun the arms ofsome other lover whereon she answered with boldness yes that thiswas so and that the name of that lover was babylon egypts ancientenemy and the one from whom she had most to fearnow pharaoh grew grave saying that this was a very great matter ofwhich he must consider with himself and his councillors after privatetalk with her then dismissing all such affairs of state he asked herhow it had fared with her during her long journey from which he hopedthat she would rest a while here in his palace at sais treating it asher own she answered that she desired nothing better who all herlife had hoped to visit egypt and acquaint herself with its wondersand its wisdomso this prepared and balanced talk went on reminding me of a heavyweight swinging to and fro and never going further or less far tillat length pharaoh bade her to a banquet that night then as though byan afterthought he addedo queen atyra the other day i sent ramose a young count of egypt inwhom runs no mean blood to your camp to welcome you in egypts namei grieve to hear that while he was there a quarrel arose between himand one of your followers and for this i ask your pardonthere is no need pharaoh she answered smiling seeing that inevery quarrel there is something to be said on either sidethen queen atyra if you can forgive him would it please you thatwhile you are here i should appoint this ramose who stands yonder tobe your chamberlain to attend upon your wants and bear your wishes tome or would you prefer that i should choose some older man to fillthis officei think that it would please me well she answered indifferentlyseeing that i found the count ramose a pleasant companion and onewith whom i could talk in greek also one who can instruct me in thecustoms and history of egypt and in its tongue all of which i desireto learn yet let it be as the pharaoh wills whoever pharaoh chooseswill be welcome to meso saying she turned her head to speak to one of her servants in herown language as though the matter troubled her not at allcount ramose said pharaoh addressing me for the days of her stayat our court we give this royal lady into your keeping let it be yourduty to wait upon her and to attend to her every want making reportto us from time to time of how she fares know ramose that we shallhold you to strict account for her safety and her welfare and that ifaught of ill befalls her while she is in your keeping you shall makeanswer for it to usthus in formal stately words was the lady atyra set in my charge iheard and bowed while the other courtiers looked on me with envy forthis was a great duty and one that should bring with it advancementand rewards yet it is true that as i bowed my heart which shouldhave leapt for joy seemed to sink and fail so that i could scarcelyfeel it beat it was as though some icy hand of fear had gripped it bythe roots a great terror took hold of me a shadow of woe to comefell upon me almost i determined to prostrate myself and pray pharaohto confer this honour on some other man one with more knowledge andolder i even turned to advance to the steps of the throne and do soalthough i knew that such a prayer would cause me to be mocked by allthe court it was too late pharaoh had risen his decree was writtenon the rolls the audience was at an endnow i will press on with the terrible story of atyra which was to turnthe current of my life and for aught i know robbed me of the throneof egypt at least so belus held as did some others though if sothat is a loss over which i do not grievefor a while all went well i waited on the queen with her officers iwas her companion at her table i instructed her as best i might inall she wished to learn for to me alone she would listen and not tobelus or another when she visited pharaoh and his councillors iaccompanied her standing back so that i might not overhear theirsecrets in short i did all those things i had been instructed to doeven to make report of everything i learned from the queen as i hadbeen biddenone day she turned on me laughing and saidi thought you were my friend ramose but i find that you are nothingbut a spy who repeats to pharaoh all i say i know it because he usedto me some of my very words thinking that they were his own whichwords could only have come to him through younow i turned aside and hung my head whereon she leant over mewhisperingfoolish boy do not think i am angry with you who know well that youmust do your duty and therefore tell you nothing that you may not cryout from every pylon top these matters of policy are between me andpharaoh or rather between syria and egypt i and you have others todiscuss that pharaoh would think dull now tell me of your boyhood andof the woman that you first thought fairso it went on and ever as i drew back so she came forward at first ithink that she was puzzled who could not understand why i resisted herand made search to find some other woman who had built a wall betweenus soon she discovered that there was none indeed she drew this outof me at last in a flash she guessed the truththat i was under anoath to my own heart or another which mattered not to treat her asa queen who was egypts guest and no morethen atyra did what she should not have done as doubtless she knowstoday she set herself to make me break that oath for nothing elsedo i blame her who i know loved me truly boy though i was but forthis how can she escape from blame she knew that her witchery was onme she knew that she had made me madindeed in those days ofresistance i went near to madness i who worshipped her as a thingdivine and yet she put out all her womans strength to break my willand cause me to forswear myselfat last the matter came to a head as such do always the feast wasover the guests had departed i presented myself as i must to takemy farewell of her for the night and found that i was alone with herin the little antechamber where a single lamp burned dimly she wasstanding at a windowplace cut in the thickness of the wall watchingthe rising of the moon a figure clad all in white but for somescarlet pomegranate blooms fastened upon her breast for her maids hadrelieved her of her royal ornaments save a girdle of gold about herwaistdiscovering her at length i advanced to inquire her commands for themorrow bow and be gonehow quietly you walk ramose she said i heard you not yet i knewthat you were coming yes i felt your presence as we do that ofthose whom we loveor hate my orders oh i have none to give you atthe moment young chamberlain why think of the morrow on such a nightas this look at that great moon rising yonder out of the desert nowonder that you egyptians set your isis in the moon for it is alovely throne fit for any goddess now of what does this one put me inmind ah i rememberof that which rose over the waters of the nilewhen you and i sat together in a ruined temple of the desert do younot remember iti muttered some answer i know not what it was and halfturned to gowhen with a swift and sudden motion she flung herself against me yesfrom her foot to her shoulder i felt all the weight of her beautifulbody leaning against mei never stirred i did nothing and yet i know not how presently herlips were on my ownshe drew away laughing low and happily and askednow ramose do you remember that night in the ruined temple when welooked together at the moon rising over the nilei fled away and as i fled still she laughedit was after this that for the first time i saw the priest ninariamong the other servitors of the queen recovered of his wounds butwearing a cap with lappets that hung down over his ears he greeted mecourteously enough but in his eyes was a fierce look that i could notmisunderstandwe quarrelled once young lord he said but now that you are theappointed guardian of my queen we are friends are we notsurely i answeredthen all is well between us young lord while you guard herfaithfully who otherwise may quarrel once more and with a differentending and again he smiled upon me with those fierce eyes and wasgoneon the evening of my meeting with ninari i was in waiting on queenatyra in the garden of which i have written and noted that she wastroubled presently she led me to a seat beneath the palms in front ofwhich lay the little pool where flowered the blue lotus lilies it wasa pleasant secluded seat hidden from the rest of the garden and fromthe palace windows by a bank of flowering shrubs and of tall reedlikeplants with feathery headswhat ails you i askedeverything ramose she answered all goes awry and i would that iwere dead my mission to pharaoh is ended and not so ill tomorrowat the dawn the egyptian general amasis with a great force most ofwhich has gone on before advances to attack the babylonians on theborders of egypt tomorrow also i leave sais to journey back to myown country it was decided but an hour ago do you understand that ileave saisi understand queen though this sudden plan amazes me why do you goso swiftlyi will tell you ninari has been with pharaoh and has told him thatnews has come from my country that those who are left in power thereurged on by the people who are afraid threaten to make peace withbabylon and that one of the terms of that peace will be that wesyrians should join the babylonians in the attack on egypt he hastold him also that there is but one hope of defeating this treacherynamely that i should return at once bearing pharaohs offers ofalliance and as the wife of ninari who alone can control thepriesthood which is the real power in the land and overthrow thisplotas the wife of ninari i gasped may the gods avert itthe gods make no sign ramose if there be any gods these ask of menthat they should carve their own fate upon the cliffs of time in thismatter ninari is the godfor a little while we sat silent staring at the lotus blooms then shespoke againdo you love me ramoseyou know that i love you i answeredyes yet your love is to my love but as a dewdrop to the waters inthat lake ramose a madness has taken hold of me i will tell you thetruth you are very young and as yet of small account in the worldwhile i am a queen who perchance will become the sovereign of a greatcountry if with egypts help we can overthrow babylon as may happennow that nebuchadnezzar grows old and feeble and there is none to takehis place still i say to you that you the son of pharaohs womanare more to me than all earths thrones and glory here fate thrustsme on not folly or passion but fate itself with an iron hand i willhave none of ninari rather than that accursed priestly hound shouldcreep into my chamber i will die or better still he shall die whoknows not with whom he has to deal yes here and now i pronounce hisdoomthus she spoke in slow cold words that yet were full of fearfulmenace then suddenly went on in a soft changed voicelet us talk no more of this foul ninari hearken if you will playthe man i have plans that shall make of you a great king and give toyou one of earths fairest and most loving women as a wife but i whoperhaps have said too much already dare not speak them here always iam watched the very air seems to play the spy upon me and even now ifeel and she shivered moreover my women wait to tire me forpharaohs farewell feast and i must be gone ramose you have the keyof the door that leads to my chambers in the first of them i sleepquite alone for i will have no one near me in my slumbers and theguards and eunuchs are set far away beyond come to me at midnight andi will tell you all will you come knowing that if aught miscarriesyour life hangs in itmy life i answered sadly what is my life something of which ithink i should be well rid could i say goodbye to it with honour ihave not been happy of late queen atyra pharaoh laid a charge uponme and forgive me for saying it it seems that always you have putout your strength to cause me to break my trust by amen i have foughtmy best but alas i am weak with love of you when your eyes shineupon me i grow dizzy and at your touch my purpose melts like wax inthe midday sun what you command that i must do and if death waits atthe end of your road may thoth the weigher of hearts be mercifuland give me sleep that i may forget my shameshe looked at me and there was pity in her eyes then the pity passedand they burned with the light of passioni grieve for you as i grieve for myself whose danger is greater thanyour own she said yet for me the choice lies between you andmadness know ramose that without you i shall go mad and ere i diework woes at which the world will shudder think is such a love asmine a gift to be lightly cast awayi will come i have said it i answeredthen she rose and wentpharaohs feast that night was very glorious and at it none wasmerrier than the queen atyra indeed she was so beautiful in her royalapparel that she drew all eyes to her and every man bent forward towatch her and hear her words yes even pharaohs self yet to me itseemed a feast of death and even the scented cup i bore to her whereinshe pledged her countrys future fellowship with egypt smelt of thetombat length it was over the dancers ended their dancing the musicfaded away the lovely queen bent before pharaoh and he kissed herhand she departed with her company the lamps died outit was midnight i unlocked the passage door i crept to her chamberlike a thief for now all my doubts were gone and i was aflame itsdoor was ajar i entered closing it behind me in the chamber burneda hanging lamp of which the flame wavered in the hot nightwind thatcame through the open windowplace there upon a couch she lay clothedall in white a thing of beauty her black locks flowing about her iwent to her i knelt down to kiss her lips but she did not stir shesaid nothing i touched her brow and lo although her shape stayedstill her head rolled towards methen i saw that her neck was severed through and through she wasdeadi rose from my knees smitten with a silent madness from behind acurtain appeared ninari a red sword in his handyoung count of egypt he said in a soft voice know that i heardall your talk with this traitress for i was hidden in the bushesbehind you in the garden now that our queen might not be shamed ihave executed the decree of my god upon her and go to make report ofwhat has been done to the people over who she ruled i bid youfarewell count ramose trusting that you who are young and weresorely tempted will have learned a lesson which cannot be forgottenmy strength came back to me i said no word i sprang at him as a lionsprings he struck i caught his arm with such a grip that the swordfell from his hand i closed with him and in the might of my madness ibroke him like a stick at least suddenly he sank together in my handsand his head fell backwardsthen i hurled him through the windowplace i took his sword and setits hilt upon the pavement purposing to fall upon it already i bentover its point when it was struck away i looked up there by mewhite wideeyed stood beluscome he said hoarsely come swiftly for your lifes sake                              chapter v                         the flight to amasisin the doorway of the chamber i glanced back by the wavering light ofthe lamp i saw the white shape of her who had been the queen atyra andmy love lying still and dreadful on the couch her head turnedstrangely as though to watch me go on the floor from beneath a rugand a splendid garment which she had worn at the feast crept the redstream that told of murder and near by it lay the sword of ninarisome jewels glittered upon a stool and among them was a flower onewhich that afternoon i had given to heryes she had taken it from myhand kissed it and set it in her girdle the moon shone through theopen windowplace out of which i had hurled ninari such was thepicture a terrible picture that in every detail must haunt me till idiei wished to turn back to recover that flower but belus thrust mebefore him and closed the door we passed down the passage to myapartment this door also belus closed and locked we stood face toface in my chamberwhat now i said drearily give me one of those drugs of yoursbelus that which kills so swiftly for all is donenay he answered all is but begun be a man and hearken the womanis dead by her lies the sword of ninari who save i knows that youentered her chamber ninari is dead also he lies broken at the footof the palace wall for i saw you cast him from the windowplace whenceit will be believed he flung himself after doing murder since he isuntouched by knife or swordi know belus i know and my face will tell the tale or i shall gomad and babble ithe nodded his wise headperchance ramose at least pharaoh will kill you because she was inyour charge or if he does not those syrians will guessing thetruth by this hand or by that death awaits you here sure death andwith it shamei seek to die i answeredyou cannot for it is written otherwise have i not read it in yourstars listen the general amasis has departed to join the army thatgoes to fight the babylonians on the frontiers of egypt pharaoh doesnot trust this amasis whom the soldiers love too well he sends me tobe his counsellor and to spy upon him and i depart within an hour forthe command is urgent disguised as my scribe you will accompany meforseeing trouble already i have ordered all tomorrow you will bemissed and perhaps it may be thought that some ill has befallen youdo not young men wander out at night and meet with adventures thathave been known to end evilly has not the nile borne the bodies ofmany such towards the sea or may not the syrians have murdered youas they murdered the queen who was known to look on you so kindly atbest there will be much talk and pharaoh will be wrath but as youhave vanished away the matter will be forgotten if afterwards it islearned that seeking adventure you went to join amasis you may beforgiventhat is unless those syrians know all and plotted thismurder answer not but come bringing your sword and what gold youhavea while later it may have been one hour or two i forget whosememory of that night is dimmed by a fog of wretchedness two figuresmight have been seen leaving that part of the palace which was calleddream house because there always dwelt the royal astrologer they leftit by a small gate guarded by a single soldier who challenged thembelus gave some password also he showed a ring and spoke in theguards earright enough all in order said the man belus the babylonian anda scribe we were commanded to pass well here is belus the babylonianwhom we all know for he tells our fortunes by the stars and theresthe scribe in a dark cloak with a hood to it a very fine young mantoo for a scribe who generally are short and roundstomached orsometimes quite small and very like a girl for many are namedscribes who never served apprenticeship in a temple or a schoolmagician belus i fear that i cannot let this scribe pass until i havecalled the officer to have a look at himor herwhat do you mean man asked belus coldly is not pharaohs ringenoughnot tonight master although you may not have heard it there istrouble yonder in the palace something terrible has happened theresome great one has been murdered who it is i know not still word hascome that all gateways are to be watched and none allowed to passwhose faces are covered or who are not known even under pharaohsseal therefore i pray you stay a minute until the officer and hisguard pass upon their roundas you will said belus and while we wait friend tell me how isthat little daughter of yours whom i visited two days ago in herfevermaster answered the man in another voice a trembling voice shehangs between life and death when i left to come on guard at lengthshe had fallen asleep and the wise women said that either it is thebeginning of the sleep of death or she will wake free of the fever andrecover tell me master you who are wise and can read the starswhich she will do for know i love this child my only one and myheart is rackedwith the staff he bore belus made a drawing in the sand then helooked up at certain stars and added dots to the drawing which donehe saidevents are strangely linked with one another in this world myfriend nor can we understand who or what it is that ties them thustogether who for instance would have dreamed that your daughtersfate hangs upon whether i and this scribe of mine whom perchance youguessed rightly to be a woman though a tall one such as are loved bysmall men like myself pass at once upon our business or wait untilit pleases some officer to wander this way upon his rounds if wepass the stars say that your daughter will live if we wait while weare waiting she will dieyes before the moonlight creeps to thatmark she will die but if my departing footstep stamps upon it shewill livepass magician belus with the girl disguised as a scribe said theman for such i see now she is though at first the moonlightdeceived me passgood night friend said belus the blessing of the gods be uponyou and upon that daughter of yours who will live to comfort your oldagethen with his foot he stamped out the pattern on the sand and we wentonwill the child live i asked idly for this sight of the grief ofanother seemed to dull my ownyes answered belus my medicines have worked well and that sleepis a presage of her recovery surely she will live but what willhappen to her father when it is learned that he has suffered someveiled traveller to pass out i do not knowperchance he will keep silence upon that matteraye but when the light comes our footprints on the sand will telltheir own tale that is unless a wind rises still by that time weshall be far away run scribe run the horses and the escort menwho are sworn to me await us in yonder groveeight days later we came to the camp of amasis upon the borders ofegypt an officer led us to the tent of amasis whom we found in jovialmood for he had dined and drunk well as was his customgreeting learned belus said amasis now tell me on what businesspharaoh sends youbelus drew out a roll laid it to his forehead and handed it toamasis sayingit is written here generalhe undid the roll glanced at it and cast it downit is written in greek he exclaimed and i an egyptian will notread greek repeat its contents nay it is needless for i have heardthem already by another messenger who has outstripped you one of myown captains whom pharaoh did not send the writing orders that i mustmake report daily or as often as may be of all that passes in thisarmy through you belus the babylonian is it not soyes answered belus calmly that is the sum of itwhich means went on amasis that you are sent here to spy upon meand all that i doyes general replied belus in the same quiet voice pharaoh asyou know is jealous and fears youwhy belusbecause the egyptians love you especially the soldiers and do notlove pharaoh who they think favours the greeks too much and in allbut blood is himself a greekthat i know is there no other reasonyes general as you may have heard like other babylonians i havesome skill in divination and in the casting of horoscopes pharaohcaused me to cast his and yours also generaland what did they say belus asked amasis leaning forwardbelus dropped his voice and answeredthey said that the star of apries wanes while that of amasis growsbright they said that ere long where shone the star of apries willshine the star of amasis alone though first for a time those twostars will ride in the heavens side by side that is what they saidthough i told apries another taledo you mean the throne asked amasis in a whisperaye the throne and a certain general wearing pharaohs crownfor a while there was silence then amasis askeddoes pharaoh send you to poison me as doubtless you can do youstrange and fateful belus who like a nightbird have flitted frombabylon to egypt for your own dark and secret purposenay and if he did i their servant am not one to fight against thestars fear nothing from me who am your friend though there areothers whom you will do well to watch now general here in this campi am in your power you can kill me if you will but that would befoolish for i have not told you all the horoscopeyour meaningit is that if you kill me as i think you had it in your mind to dobut now me or another that star of yours will never shine alonebecause my blood will call for yours am i safe with you and if i needit will you protect me when you grow greatyou are safe and i will protect you now and always i swear it byamen and by maat goddess of truth yet why do you turn from pharaohwho has sheltered you ever since you escaped from babylonfor i haveheard that you did escape on account of some crimebecause pharaoh turns from me and presently will seek my life indeedi think that he seeks it already for the rest the crime of which youhave heard was not mine but that of anotherupon whom i wait to beavenged in some faroff appointed hour he added and as he spoke thewords his face grew fierce and even terriblebe plain belus but tell me first who is this with you who listensto our most secret thoughts how comes it that i never noted himperchance because i willed that you should not general or perchancebecause wine dims the eyes but look on him and answer your ownquestionas he spoke very swiftly belus bent forward and unclasped the longcloak which i wore revealing me clad as a soldier with an armouredcap upon my head amasis stared at meby the gods he said this is none other than ramose pharaohsbastard and my pupil in arms whom i love well now what does thisyoung cock here is he another of pharaohs spies whom you havebrought to be your witnessa poor spy i think general nay like me he flies from pharaohswrath there has been trouble in the palace a certain syrian queenwhom you will remember for in truth she sent you here has come toher enda swift and bloody endas has her ministeri have heard as much for rumour of the death of great ones fliesmore swiftly than a dove but what has that to do with ramose did heperchance stifle her with kisses as i would have done at his agenothing nothing at all general but ramose was her guardian andchamberlain and pharaoh demands his life in payment for hers so doher syrians or will ere long therefore he seeks refuge under theshield of amasis his captainand shall have it by the gods am i a man to give up one who hasserved under me over the matter of a woman even to pharaohs selfnot so and yet i must remember that this youngster is pharaohs sonand half a greek and has heard words that would set a noose about myneck do you vouch for him belusaye amasis listen from boyhood this lad has been as one born to meand i who now amchildlesslove him he has been drawn intotrouble and thereby as i fear embroiled syria and egypt thereforehis life is forfeit as is mine who have befriended him and aided hisescape therefore too both of us have fled to you and henceforwardswear ourselves to your service looking to you to shield us tell usmay we sleep in peace or must we seek it elsewhereyes you may sleep easy even from pharaoh for here in this camp iam pharaoh answered amasis proudly have i not sworn it already andam i a trothbreaker he addedscarce had the words passed his lips when from without came a sound ofsentries challenging followed by a cry of pass on messenger ofpharaoh the tent opened and there appeared a travelstained man cladin pharaohs uniform who bowed handed a roll to amasis and at asign retiredpharaoh sends me many letters he said as he cut the silk and undidthe roll then he read looked up and laughedyour guardian spirit must be good belus at least you two were wiseto take that oath of me upon the instant hearken to what is writtenhere and he read aloud pharaoh to the general amasis the syrians who came hither with the queen atyra who is dead as  the price of the friendship of their nation to egypt demand the  life of the count ramose who was her chamberlain because he  failed in his duty and did not keep her safe also because as they  allege he murdered one ninari if he has fled to your camp  disguised as a scribe as is reported put him to death and send  his head to sais that it may be shown to them with it send belus  the babylonian that the truth of all this matter may be wrung  from him  sealed with the seals of pharaoh and his viziernow belus went on amasis tell me you who are wise in counselwhat shall i do obey pharaoh or my oathi listened like to one in a dream but belus answered quietlywhich you will amasis obey pharaoh cause this lad to be murderedand send me to the torturers at sais and see your star setas ipromised you obey your oath and see that star shine out above allstorms royally and alone yet is it needful to urge amasis tohonesty by revealing what thoth has written concerning him in the bookof fatei think not answered amasis with his great laugh do they not sayof me in egypt that never yet did i break troth with friend or foeand shall i do so now young man i see that you have scribes toolsabout you therefore be seated and write these words from amasis the general to pharaoh the letter of pharaoh has been received know o divine pharaoh  that it is not the custom of amasis to kill those who are serving  under him in war save for cowardice or other military offence if  the syrians have aught against the count ramose let them come  hither and set out their case before me and my captains for the  rest belus the babylonian whom the good god pharaoh sent hither  to watch me is too weary to travel moreover i keep him at my  side that i may watch himwhen i had finished writing amasis read the roll sealed it andsummoning an officer bade him to give it to the messenger to bedelivered to pharaoh at sais when the officer had gone he thought awhile and said in his open fashionthe quarrel between me and pharaoh or rather between the egyptiansand his friends the greeks has long been brewing it is strange thatit should have boiled over upon the little matter of this young countand his love affairs yet doubtless so it was decreed have no fearramose pharaoh is cowardly for otherwise he would not seek the lifeof his own son for such a trifle from dread born of syrian threats atyrant also and when tyrants are taken by the beard they grow afraidyet my counsel to both of you is to keep out of the reach ofpharaohs arm till this business is forgotten if ever he speaks of itto me again i will tell him to his face that he should thank me whohave saved him from the crime of murdering his son whose blood wouldhave brought the curse of the gods upon him now drink a cup of wineboth of you and let me hear this tale of the death of atyra if shebe dead in truthso i told it to him keeping nothing back when it was done he saidi am glad that you threw that syrian rat through the windowplacesending him to settle his account with atyra in the underworld grievenot young man there are more women left upon the earth who willteach you to forget your trouble and for the rest this illfated ladywas one hard to be resisted now go rest tomorrow i will find you aplace in my bodyguard and we shall see whether you are luckier in warthan you have been in lovethus he spoke though in the after years when he had ceased to be abluff general and had become a wily pharaoh steeped in statecraft heforgot or pretended to forget all this story and asserted that atyrahad borne me a child before her death but of this in its seasonthat night ere i slept for the first time i opened all my heart tobelus showing him how great was its bitterness and woe moreover itold him that if i escaped the wrath of pharaoh and the accidents ofwar i had sworn an oath before the gods to have no more to do withwomeni rejoice to hear it son answered belus with his strange wisesmile and i pray that the memory of the gods of egypt is not toolong you say that you have done with women but mayhap women have notdone with such a man as you nor because one has brought you sorrowis it certain that another may not bring you joy now grieve no moreover what cannot be mended nor for her who is dead because of you butfollow after fortune with a brave heart for such she loves only onething i hope of you that you will suffer me your master to stay atyour side through bad weather and through good until perhaps i amdrawn away to fulfil the purpose of my lifethen without telling me what was that purpose he kissed me on thebrow and i laid me down and slept                              chapter vi                           the gift of godnext day the march began i saw and knew all for amasis a man of hisword in those days appointed me to be an officer of his guard alsobecause i was a scholar one of his private scribes further he keptbelus in attendance on him so that between us we learned all therewas to know thus i came to understand how great was the power ofamasis the beloved of the soldiersabout him was none of the ceremonial of pharaohs court his captainswere his fellows also he drank jested and bandied stories some ofthem coarse enough with the common soldiers round their fires a manof the people himself he talked to them of their fathers yes andmothers too he asked no great reverence from them nor that any manshould bow to the dust when he passed by and to many a fault he wasblind if one off duty drank too much or broke camp to seek some girlwho had looked at him kindly he said nothing but if such a one didthese things when he was on duty then let him beware for he would beflogged or even hanged no man was promoted for lipservice orbecause his birth was high but to those who were brave and loyalevery door was open therefore the army loved him so much indeed thathe dared to defy pharaoh in such a letter as he had written concerningbelus and myself and yet fear nothingsome thirty or forty thousand strong not counting the campfollowerswe marched against the babylonians a great host of them under thecommand of merodach said to be a son of nebuchadnezzar who awaitedus beyond the borders of egypt or rather they did not await us for aswe came on they retreated then we discovered that we were being ledinto a trap for syrians by the ten thousand were hanging on ourflank waiting to cut us off belus learned this from spies whom we hadtaken but who it seemed belonged to some secret brotherhood ofwhich he was a chieffor although belus was willing to fight against his own people ifound that among them he still had many friends this at the time icould not understand for not until many years had gone by did i cometo know that the babylonians were divided among themselves numbers ofthem hating the kings who ruled over them and all their cruelties andwarsso amasis separated his army half of it he left entrenched upon arange of little hills that encircled an oasis where there was water inplenty beyond which hills the babylonians had retreated thinking todraw us into the desert on their further side the rest among whomwere nearly all the horsemen and chariots he sent to swoop down onthe syrians making a long night march we caught them at the dawn justas they were breaking camp until we fell upon them they did not knowthat we were near therefore although they outnumbered us by three toone our victory was great hemming them round in the gloom weattacked at daybreak and slew thousands of them before they could formtheir ranks also we made prisoners of thousands more and took a greatbooty of horses and camelsthis done we returned to the low hills in a fortunate moment fordiscovering that the half of our army was gone at length thebabylonians had determined to attack night was falling when wereached the camp and therefore they did not see us advancing undercover of the hills some of us i among them pushed on and madereport to amasis of how it had gone between us and the syrians a talethat pleased him greatly moreover having heard me well spoken of bythose under whom i served for the part i played in that fray hepromoted me to be captain of a company of which the officer had beenkilled by an arrow this company was part of what was called thegenerals legion appointed to surround him in battle and to fightunder his own command i knew it already since from it was drawn hisbodyguard of whom i had been one until i was sent out against thesyriansnext morning at the dawn from the crest of our hills far away uponthe plain and half hidden by clouds of dust we saw the babyloniansapproaching a mighty host of them indeed so countless were they andso vast was their array that at sight of it my heart sank for itseemed as though for every man of ours they could count ten while istood staring at them suddenly i found amasis himself at my sidewrapped in a common soldiers cloakyou are afraid young man he said your face shows it well ithink none the worse of you for that yet take courage since it isnot numbers that make an army terrible but discipline and the will toconquer look now at this great host as its standards show it ismade up of many peoples all mixed together see it keeps no goodline for its left wing is far advanced and its right straggles alsoits centre where is merodach the kings son with his chosen guardsis cumbered with many waggons and litters in those waggons are notfood or water but women for these soft babylonians soaked in luxurywill not move without their women even in war and they must beprotected therefore i say to you and to all be not afraidthen he departed to talk to othersall that morning the babylonian multitude came on slowly till by noonthey were within a mile of us during the heat of the day they restedfor some two hours or more then once more they advanced as wethought to the attack but it was not so for when they had coveredanother three furlongs again they halted as though bewildered perhapsbecause they could see so few of us for the most of our army washidden behind the crest of a hill at length officers rode forwardfive or six of them carrying a white flag and reined up almost atthe foot of the hillsamasis sent some forward to speak with them among whom was beluswhose tongue was their own disguised as an egyptian captain a garbthat became him ill they talked a long while then belus and theothers returned and reported that the prince and general merodachgave us leave to retire unmolested also that he offered a greatpresent of gold to amasis and his captains if this were done thenhe said he would retire to babylon and make it known to the kingnebuchadnezzar that he had gained a victory over the egyptians whohad fled at the sight of his armywhen amasis heard this he laughed nevertheless he sent back belusand the others to ask how much gold babylon would pay as a tribute topharaoh and so it went on all the afternoon till at length amasisknew that it was too late for the babylonians to attack for nightdrew near then he sent a last message demanding that the babyloniansshould surrender and give hostages also the gold that they hadoffered this was the end of itlater belus came and told me the meaning of this play thosebabylonians have no water he said save what they carry with themtomorrow they will be thirsty and drink all leaving nothing for thehorses and the elephants that they thought would drink at the springsof the oasis tonight truly amasis is a good generalall that night we watched thought with little fear for there was nomoon and we knew that in such darkness the babylonians would not dareto attack now i thought that amasis would fall on them at the dawnas we had done on the syrians but he did not who said that thirstwas the greatest of captains and he would leave him in command stillwhen he had seen that all our army was well fed and all our horseswere well watered he sent out a body of cavalry five thousand ofthem perhaps with orders to charge at the centre of the babyloniansas they began to muster their array and then suddenly to retire asthough seized with panicthis was done when they saw the horsemen coming the babyloniansformed up with great shoutings and the elephants were advanced as iffrightened at the sight of these elephants our men wheeled about andfled back towards the hills though not too fast now happened thatwhich amasis had hopedthe enemy broke his ranks and pursued the egyptians elephantschariots and clouds of horse pursued them all mingled together whileafter them came the bulk of the host the word went down our lines tostand firm behind the crest of the hill we opened and let ourhorsemen through to reform behind us which they did having scarcelost a man then we closed again and waitedthe hordes were upon us chariots horse and elephants toiled up thesandy slopes of the hills slipping back one step for every twoforward at a signal our bowmen rose and loosed their arrows cloudafter cloud of arrows soon the heads and trunks of the elephants werefull of them maddened with pain the great brutes turned and rusheddown the hill crushing all they met the horses also those of themthat were not killed did likewise while the sand was strewn withdead or wounded men the charge turned to a rout and few that tookpart in it reached the great army unharmed still so vast was it thatthose who had fallen with their beasts were but a tithe of itsnumbers though now few of the elephants were fit for service and thechariots and the horsemen had suffered muchat this repulse rage seized the babylonians or their generalstrumpets blew banners waved words of command were shouted thensuddenly the whole host countless thousands of them whose frontstretched over a league of land began their advance against ourlittle line of hills that measured scarcely more than four furlongsfrom end to endamasis saw their plan which was to encircle and closing in frombehind to overwhelm us with the weight of their number he dividedour horse into two bodies and weary as they still were from theirjourney against the syrians commanded them to charge round the endsof the hills and to cut through those wings leaving the breast of thegreat host like a bull with severed horns this they did well enoughcharging forward and back again through and through thosebabylonians or their allies till between the horns and the headthere were great gaps after which they changed their tactics andcharged at the tips of the horns crumpling them up till from orderedcompanies they became a mobmeanwhile the breast advanced leaving a reserve to guard the waggonsand the stores and the plain belowwave upon wave of the picked troops of babylon they dashed up at uslike breakers against a reef and the real fight beganwe raked them with our arrows killing hundreds but always morepoured on till they came to the crest of the hills and met theegyptians sword to sword and spear to speari had no part in that fight who stood behind in reserve with thegenerals legion that guarded amasis and egypts banners yet i saw itall and noted that many of those who attacked were wasted withthirst for their mouths were open and their tongues hung out whilethe hot sun beat down upon their helms and armouramasis saw it also for i heard him say i thank the gods that theyhave given me no babylonian prince to be the captain of my life nowon them egyptianswe rose we charged we drove them before us in a tumbled mass downthose bloodstained slopes we drove them yes there they died by thehundred and the thousand at the foot of the hill we reformed formany of us had been killed or wounded in the great fray then wecharged at the heart of the babylonian host where flew the banners oftheir general the prince merodach a dense array of fifteen or twentythousand of the best of their troops set to guard the general thewomen and the baggage we fell on them like a flood but were rolledback from their triple line as a flood is from a wall of rock we hungdoubtful whose force after all was small when suddenly at the head ofabout a thousand of his guards whom he had kept in reserve amasishimself charged past us we the rest of that legion would not beleft behind leaving our dead and wounded we charged with him how ithappened i do not know but we broke the triple line we went into itas a wedge goes into wood and it split in twosuddenly i saw the inmost body of horsemen that surrounded thebabylonian standards wheel about and gallop off a soldier cried intomy earmerodach flies yes he flies babylon is beatenso it was indeed for when the host saw that their general haddeserted them with his guard of chariots and horsemen the heart wentout of them no longer were they battalions of brave men nay theybecame but as sheep driven by wolves or dogs they packed togetherthey fled this way and that trampling one upon the other they foughtno more they flung down their arms each man seeking to save his ownlife the egyptians slew and slew until they were weary then thetrumpets called them back save the horsemen that for a while followedthe wings of the army which seeing what had happened abandoned hopeand joined in the routwhat happened to that host i do not know thousands of them died butthousands more wandered off into the desert seeking safety and waterbut above all water at the wells in their rear i can see them now amotley crowd elephants camels chariots horse and footmen allmingled together till at length they vanished in the distance exceptthose who fell by the way doubtless many of them reached babylon andtold their tale of disaster into the ears of nebuchadnezzar the greatking but he was aged and it was said distraught almost on hisdeathbed indeed and had heard many such before always his hostsgathered from the myriads of the east were going forth to battlesometimes they conquered sometimes they were defeated it matteredlittle seeing that there were always more myriads out of which newhosts could be formed in babylon and assyria and the lands aroundlife was plentiful and cheap for there men bred like flies in the mudand sun and wealth was great and when the king commanded they mustgo out to diethe victory was won now came its fruits the hour of plunder was athand there were the great parks of waggons filled with stores andwomen there were the pavilions of the royal prince the generals andthe officers amasis himself riding down our lines his helmet in hishand laughing as ever shouted to us to go and take but to becareful to keep him his sharewe rushed forward without rank or order for now there was nothing tofear all the enemy were fled save those who lay dead or woundedswart blackbearded men i being young and swift of foot outran myfellows we came to the pavilion of the prince over which the bannersof babylon hung limply in the still air the soldiers swarmed into itseeking treasure but i who cared nothing for golden cups or jewelsran round to another pavilion in its rear which i guessed would bethat of the women why i did this i was not sure for i wanted womeneven less than the other spoil but i think it must have been becausei was curious and desired to see what these ladies were like and howthey were housedthus it came about that i entered this place alone and letting fallthe flap of the tent which was magnificent and lined with silk andembroideries stared round me till my eyes grew accustomed to theshadowed light and i saw that it was empty no not empty for at itsend seated on a couch was a glittering figure clad it seemed insilver mail and beside it something over which a veil was thrownthinking that this was a man i drew my sword which i had sheathedand advanced cautiouslynow i was near and the figure of which the head was bowed looked upand stared at me then i saw that the face beneath the silver helm wasthat of a woman a very beautiful woman with features such as thegreeks cut upon their gems and large dark eyes i gazed at her andshe gazed at me then she spoke first in a tongue which i did notunderstand and when i shook my head in greekegyptian if so you be she said seek elsewhere after the otherswho are fled i am no prize for youshe threw aside a broidered cape that hung over her mail and i sawthat piercing the mail was an egyptian arrow of which the featheredshaft was broken off also that blood ran to her knees staining thearmouri muttered words of pity saying that i would bring a physician forsuddenly i bethought me of belusit is useless she said the hurt is mortal already i dienot knowing what to do i made as though to leave her then stoodstill and all the while she watched meyou are young and have a kindly face said she high born too orso i judge look and with a swift motion she cast off the veil fromthat which rested against herbehold it was a child of three or four years of age a lovely childbeautifully attiredmy daughter my only one she said save her o egyptian captaini stepped forward and bent down to look at the child at this momentsome soldiers burst into the tent and saw us wheeling round iperceived that they were men of my own companybegone i cried whereon one of them called outwhy it is our young captain the count ramose who woos a captiveaway comrades she is his not ours by the laws of war away andtell the rest to seek elsewherethen laughing in their coarse soldier fashion they departed andpresently i heard them shouting that this tent must be left alonesave her count ramose if such be your name repeated the womanhearken she is no mean child for i am a daughter of him who oncewas king of israel now at the last i grow clearsighted and a voicetells me to trust you whom my god has sent to me to be my friendswear to me by him you worship that you will guard this child yoursby spoil of war that you will not sell her on the market that youwill keep her safe and clean and when she comes to womanhood sufferher to wed where she will swear this and i mysia of the royal houseof israel will call down the blessing of jehovah on you and yours andall your work as should you fail me i will call down his cursea great oath i exclaimed hesitating to be taken by one who is nooath breakeraye great great yet hearken she is not dowerlessshe glanced about her wildly to make sure that we were alone thenfrom her side or perhaps from some hidingplace in the couch shedrew a broidered bag and thrust it into my handshide it she said these royal jewels are her heritage among themare pearls without pricei thrust the bag into the pouch i carried throwing from it the waterbottle and the food which it had contained then i answeredi swear yet believe me lady not for the gems sakei know it count ramose for such eyes as yours were never given to arobber of the helplessthen as i knew by the motion of her hands she blessed me in astrange tongue hebrew i suppose and blessed her daughter alsotake her she said presently in greek for i dieshe bent down and kissed the child then tried to lift her but couldnot being too weak to bear her weight i took her in my arms askinghow is she named and who was her fathermyra is her name she gasped in a faint voice then her eyes closedshe fell sideways on the couch groaned and presently was deadlifting the veil with which it had been covered when first i enteredthe tent i threw it over the child which seemed to be drugged ormayhap had swooned with fear cast one last glance at the pale beautyof her dead mother who looked indeed as though she sprang from theblood of kings and departed from that tent which presently thesoldiers plundered and burnedhere i will say that of this ladys history i heard no more for manyyears she declared herself to be a daughter of a king of jerusalemand i half believed the story thinking that at the moment of death shewould not lie to me certainly such a captive when she grew towomanhood might well have been taken by a kings son as one of hishousehold also the jewels which the lady mysia gave to me weresplendid and priceless such as kings might own being for the mostpart necklaces of great pearls among these also was an emeraldcylinder on which were graven signs and writing that i could not reada talisman of power as i learned afterwards but of this in its placedeparting from the tent and skirting the great pavilion of merodach ipassed through groups of soldiers counting or quarrelling over theirspoils as night fell i climbed the slopes of the little hills thatwere thick with dead for by now after the cruel fashion of war allthe enemys wounded had been slain at length i came to the tent whichi shared with belus laughed at on the way by one or two because ofthe great bundle of spoil which i carried in my armshere i found that philosopher who had put off the armour which becamehim so ill clad in his own garments and engaged in eating a simplemeal of bread and sundried fruits when he had greeted me which hedid heartily rejoicing to see me come safe from the battle for thefirst time in the dusk of the tent he noted the bundle in my armsit is strange how the wisest of us may be deceived i have watchedyou from boyhood and thought that i knew your mind ramose indeed iwould have sworn that whatever your faults you were one who caredlittle for spoil yet i see that you have been plundering like thecommonestaye belus i have been plundering and found a rich treasure yet ithink one of which no one will wish to rob me lift the veil andlookhe did so while i turned to the door of the tent so that the last ofthe daylight fell upon me and my burden belus stared at the child whostill slept or swooned then he stared at me sayingnow i wonder what god is at work in this business and to what endthe god of mercy i think if there be such a one which i find ithard to believe just now i answered then i told him all the storythere are certain oaths that may be broken and yet leave the soul ofhim who swore them but little stained and there are others of whicheven the stretching calls down heavens vengeance such a one ramoseis that which you took before the dying mother of this child who bynow doubtless has registered it in the recorders book beyond theearth henceforth for good or evil she is your chargei know it belusyet what is to be done he went on how can you remain a soldierwho have a babe tied to your girdlei do not wish to remain a soldier who have seen enough of slaughterbelusif you marry your wife will look askance at this little maiden andperchance maltreat her ramose for what woman would believe a tale of a babe found upon the battlefieldi do not wish to marry belus have i not told you that i have donewith womenyes but here a thought seemed to strike him for he grew silentand at that moment the child awoke and began to wailwe quieted her as best we could and fed her with bread soaked in themilk of goats or camels i forget which for of all these belus had astore in the tent till at last she fell asleep in my arms then ilaid her on my bed and gave belus the jewels these he hid away amonghis charms and medicines where none would dare to search for them lestsome spell should be loosed upon them for all the egyptians heldbelus to be a great magicianthey are the childs and holy he said and therefore we need giveno account of them to the tellers of the spoilto which i answered that this was so and turned to gaze upon the giftthat god had sent to me as i gazed a great love of that sweet childentered my heart where it still lives today                             chapter vii                    ramose seeks refuge in cypruswhen i woke on the following morning the sun was up and save for thechild myra i found myself alone in the tent she was seated by meupon the rugs which spread upon the sand made my soldiers couchlooking at me with her large dark eyes when she saw that i wasawake she asked for her mother speaking in the babylonian tongue ofwhich i knew much even in those days having learned it from belus itold her that her mother had gone away leaving me to watch her and ithink she understood for she began to weep then i took her in my armsand kissed her till presently she ceased weeping and kissed me backat which my heart went out to her who was an orphan in the power ofstrangerspresently belus returned bringing with him a woman called metep thewidow of a soldier who had been killed by a fall from his horse at thebeginning of our march this metep was the daughter of a peasant ofthe delta not wellfavoured but kindhearted one too who had lovedher husband and would have naught to do with the trollops of the campwhere she must stay earning her living as she could do till the armyreturned to egypt as it chanced she who counted some thirty yearswas childless yet she loved children as those often do who havenone therefore we hired her to be the nurse of little myra whom shetended well and watched as though she were her own preparing her foodand making her garments of stuffs that came from the spoils of thebabylonian campbelus told me that he had visited this camp at the break of dayhoping to learn something of the lady mysia who while she was dyinghad told me that she was the daughter of a jewish king in this hefailed for drunken soldiers had fired the tent after plundering itand though he saw a body lying among the ashes it was so charred thathe could not tell whether it were that of man or woman also it woreno armour such as i had seen of which perhaps it had been stripped bysome marauder who if it was silver broke it up for meltingalso both then and afterwards he questioned certain prisoners butcould learn nothing of this lady mysia who perhaps among thebabylonians went by some other name merodach they said had women inhis train as had other princes and lords but who these were they didnot know for after the eastern fashion they were kept apart and whenthe host marched travelled on camels in covered panniers orsometimes in closed litters but now death had taken those who led thebeasts or bore the litters and with them the most of the lords whoowned the women the slaughter having been very great therefore nonewas left to tell their tale even if it were knownso the beauteous lady mysia and her history were lost in the darknessof the past which even the eyes of belus the diviner could notpierceamasis summoned the army and made an oration he praised it he showedthat its victory had been very marked over a mighty host thatoutnumbered it many times that it had been won by discipline andcourage of his own skill in generalship he said nothing and thiswithout the aid of greeks here the thousands of his hearers shoutedin their joy those greeks whom pharaoh leant upon and thoughtnecessary in war holding as he did that they outpassed the egyptiansin all qualities that make a soldierwhen he had given time for these cunning words of his to sink into thehearts of his hearers where as he guessed they would bear fruit inthe future among egyptians who hated and were jealous of the greeksthat pharaoh favoured amasis spoke of other mattershe said that after taking thought and counsel with his captains hehad determined not to follow the babylonians into their own countrythat host he declared is utterly destroyed few of them will liveto behold the walls of the great city for thirst and the desert menwill cut off many of those who escaped the battle but the king ofbabylon has other armies to fight us who are few and warworn aftertwo victories and whose horses are wearied with heat and worklastly friends i have no command from pharaoh the good god ourmaster to pursue the babylonians across the deserts but only that ishould beat them back from the borders of egypt and because of yourvalour this has been done now therefore with your leave we willreturn to sais and make our report to pharaohonce more the army shouted applause for nothing did they desire lessthan to march into the burning waterless deserts there to fight newbattles against the countless hosts of babylon they who wished toreturn to their wives and children having earned the plots of wateredland that pharaoh promised to his victorious soldiersthis matter finished amasis spoke of that of the booty which was verygreat for the babylonian camp had been full of riches also thousandsof horses and beasts of burden had been captured during and after thebattle this spoil he commanded all men to bring in that his officersmight divide it among them according to their rank next morning thiswas done though not without many quarrels for all who had capturedanything wished to keep it for themselves amongst others i appearedcarrying the child myra in whose garments were hidden the jewelsthat her mother had given to me this i did because the punishment ofthose who withheld anything was death also because i felt that myhonour was at stake although this wealth was not mine but thechildswhen i appeared before the officers bearing myra in my arms a greatlaugh went up one cried out how shall this plunder be dividedanother answered let the little one be taken and sold in the slavemarket to which a third replied who then will carry her to saisbut the officer who acted as judge behind whom stood amasis watchingall asked of medo you demand this child as your share of the loot count ramoseyes i answered i saved her from the battlefield and i demand herand all that she wears upon her bodystrip her cried one her shift may be of goldthe officer hesitated but amasis saidby the gods are we babesearchers if the captain ramose wishes fora child who he says that he has found upon the battlefield let himtake her and welcome with all that is on her who knows perhaps hefound her before he left egypt he added laughing as did the othersso that danger passed with a soldiers jest and bowing i went onon the second day from this of the dividing of the spoil our returnmarch began the army being heavy laden and weary and having nothingmore to fear travelled slowly and in no close array one of thereasons why amasis was so beloved of the soldiers that afterwards theymade him pharaoh was that he never oppressed them or forced them tohard tasks that were not needed such as the fortifying of camps in anempty land hence each man went much as he would though none wasallowed to straggle or to leave the host and i was able to keep thechild myra close to me and often riding on my horse thus it happenedthat from the first she grew to love me and if we were separated forlong would weep and refuse her foodso at last we came to pelusium where to reach sais the army must crossthe mouths of the nile here amasis sent for me and belusi have bad news for you he said apries your father is in an evilmood even our great victory over the babylonians does not rejoice himovermuch almost might one think that he would have been betterpleased had we been driven back perhaps because he thinks that acertain general is more talked of in egypt today than is pharaohsself nor is this all as he can find fault with little else he isangry because i did not obey his order to send to him your headramose and with it belus still carrying his upon his shoulders forhis spies have told him that you are with the army and have beenpromoted by me in reward of your deeds again he bids me fulfil hiscommands saying that the syrians have given him much troubleconcerning you and demand your life continuallynow i looked at him in question but belus asked outrightis such your purpose generali do not know he answered a man must think of himself sometimesand i cannot always be troubled by pharaoh about a young count and acertain physician and diviner such a matter would be a small causeover which to quarrel with pharaoh though it well may be that weshall quarrel ere all is done as i think you read in your starsbelus hearken this war is finished and your service is over thereare many boats sailing down the nile some of them large ships boundfor cyprus and elsewhere taking with them soldiers whose service isended or who have been wounded and seek their homes also merchantsnow here i set few guards and if tomorrow when i make public searchfor the count ramose and belus the babylonian that i may deliver themto pharaoh they cannot be found am i to blame i have spokenand we have heard answered belusthen amasis shook us by the hand in his friendly fashion and thankedme for my small share in the war saying that he had watched me andthat i might make a good general one day if i gave my mind to armsand ceased from dreaming like a lovesick girl or he added withmeaning perhaps something higher than a general you who have oldblood in youto belus also he said that time alone would show whether he were atrue diviner but that certainly he was the best of physicians asmany a sick and wounded man in the army knew that day nor was thisall as we were leaving the chamber for we spoke together in a houseamasis called me back and thrust into my hand a bag saying that itwas my share of the spoil which i might find useful in my wanderingswhich bag i found afterwards was filled with babylonian gold thesight of that gold i remember made me feel ashamed when i thought ofthe priceless pearls that had been hidden from him till i recalledthat these were not mine but little myras inheritancethus i bade farewell to the great captain amasis whom i was to see nomore for years indeed i bade farewell for ever to the amasis i knewfor when we met again and he had exchanged a generals staff forpharaohs sceptre in many ways he was a very different mannext morning at the dawn a merchant and his assistant for as such wewere disguised with their servant a peasant woman and her childhaving hired passages sailed amidst a motley crowd upon a ship boundfor certain ports along the coast and afterwards for the isle ofcyprus to cyprus in the end we came in safety and as i think unknownof any for all were intent upon their own affairs moreover the seabeing rough in no mood for watching others also the most of themleft the ship at the coast portsreaching salamis the greatest and most beautiful city of cyprus wehired a lodging there in a humble street giving out that we werestrangers who had escaped from tyre which was beleaguered by thebabylonians and taking new nameshere at salamis we dwelt for many years belus whom i called myuncle the brother of my mother practising as a physician also insecret as a diviner under the name of azar and i as a merchant whodealt in corn and copper and was known as ptahmes nor did we labourin vain for although we made no show during those years we grew richthe mean street in which we dwelt one running down towards the sea ata point where the ships anchored once had been a great thoroughfareinhabited by rich merchants now these had deserted it for otherquarters where the highborn dwelt around the palace of theirchieftain who was called king of salamis for in cyprus there weremany kings who at this time owned the pharaoh of egypt as theiroverlord yet their stone and marble palaces remained turned toseamens lodges marts where every kind of merchandize was sold tomariners thieves quarters or even brothelsthe house to which we had come by chance had been perhaps thegreatest of these palaces built of white stone or marble itcontained many fine chambers surrounding a courtyard and behind itwas a large garden with a fountain fed from a spring where grew somefig trees and an ancient olive but for the rest covered with nettlesand rank growth this house or rather palace wherein at first we hadhired but a few rooms by degrees we bought for no great price sothat at length it was all our own leaving the front unkempt and dirtyas of old also those spaces and the portico where i bought and soldthus to deceive curious eyes and with them an outer lodge that oncehad been a shrine dedicated to the worship of some cyprian god inwhich belus dispensed medicine or in a back chamber madedivinations i set myself to repair the rest of that great buildingby degrees with thought and care by help of skilled artists of cyprusand of greece i made it beautiful as it had been in the day of itssplendour when it was the home of merchant princes i scraped itsmarble halls and columns i mended the broken statues that stoodaround them or procured others of a like sort and perhaps by the samesculptors to stand upon their pedestals i dug the dirt from themosaics on the floor and hired good workmen to relay what was lackingto clean out the marble baths that had been filled with rubbish andset the furnaces in order to repaint the walls whence the frescoeshad faded and i know not what besides lastly i restored all thegreat garden that had become a refuse heap rebuilding the high wallabout it making paths and flowerbeds and setting a summerhouseunder the ancient fig and olive trees that happily none had troubledto cut downthus it came about that although no one would have so believed wholooked at it from the dirty street where drunkards roamed at nightslatterns screamed and fought and children played or begged of thepasserby within the discoloured front like to that of the temple ofsome forgotten god lay a mansion wellordered white and beautifulfilled with willing servants sworn to us under the oaths of some orderof which belus was a chief a home worthy to be inhabited by the greatones of the earthwhy did i do all these things and why did belus help in the work forsundry reasons first because then as now i loved all that isbeautiful all that lights the soul through the windows of the eyesand secondly because i who was a scholar when i ceased to be amerchant needed calm and quiet and fit places in which to store mymanuscripts where i could study them in peace yet behind all thislay a deeper reason i was a celibate one who because of a terrorthat had struck me in my boyhood had forsworn woman and determined tofill her place with philosophy and learning also with the study ofreligion and of the nature of the gods and of men and of how thesemay draw near to the divinethe arts of magic and divination however i left alone having alwaysheld these to be unlawful though belus who practised them after thefashion of the babylonians the great masters of starlore and ofsorcery thought otherwise yet when we reasoned about the matter heconfessed to me that these were twoedged weapons which often cutthose who wielded them also that the answers which spirits gave forthe most part might be read in more ways than one still at times hewas a good prophet for example when he foresaw that trouble would bebrought upon me by the beauteous queen atyra and that the generalamasis would rise to pharaohs throne which then no one else so muchas guessed except perhaps amasis himself in whose mind belus mayhave read itfor the rest these gifts of belus were of great service to usinasmuch as they brought us into the councils of the highest in theland for these of cyprus were very superstitious and would pay greatsums for oracles and horoscopes protecting those who furnished themfrom all harm since such foreseeing men were looked upon as prophetsfavoured of heaventhus drawing gain from all these sources trade medicine anddivination living under our false names we grew both wealthy andpowerful though with politics and plottings we would have naught todo and outwardly remained humble and of no accountto tell all the truth there was a further reason why i made that oldpalace which to the passerby seemed a mere relic of past greatnessso beautiful within filling it with everything that was perfect andlovely myra was that reason from the beginning as i have said thischild loved me as a father aye and more seeing that even in earlyyouth a maid will favour other men besides her own father becausenature so teaches her with myra it was otherwise she clung to mealone though belus she liked well enough also she loved her nursemetep in a fashion and as she loved me so i loved her indeed shewas my all the eyes of my head and the heart within my breast hadshe died swept off of some sickness of which there were many incyprus especially in the hot season i think that i should have diedalso or perhaps have slain myself that i might follow her to theshadestherefore my desire was that those sweet innocent eyes of hers shouldnever look save upon what was gracious and uplifting and that on thetablets of her mind should be written nothing that was not pure andholy i was her tutor also in the mornings and after my traffickingwas done in the evening we studied together reading the grecianpoets when she was old enough or sometimes the hieroglyphics ofegypt of which i expounded the hidden lorebelus took a hand in this game also teaching her the wisdom ofbabylon its writing and its tongue showing her the motions of thestars and how the world moved among them telling her too thehistory of israel and other nations and instructing her in figuresso this child grew learned beyond her years for her mind was quickand bright though at times she had her thoughtful moods in body shegrew also tall and straight and very fair to see darkeyed yet withhair the brown colour of ripe corn which told perhaps of the intermingling of her hebrew blood with some more western stock thus atlast in that hot land she came near to womanhood and her mind growingever ripened till although more wayward it was the equal of my ownand in certain ways its masterone day belus came upon us seated side by side studying an oldmanuscript with the lamplight shining on our faces and stoodcontemplating us with that strange secret smile of his playing roundhis withered lips our work done myra rose and went upon a householderrand when she was gone belus saidyou two make a handsome pair and look so much of an age that somemight think that you were not father and daughter as it is given outyou arenor are we i answered with a start at least in bloodthen i was silent for the thought troubled mehas not the time come went on belus when this maiden should betold how she fell into your keepingperhaps i answered do you tell her belus for i cannottell her he did in what words or when i do not know at least on thefollowing evening at the hour when we were wont to work myra came andsat opposite to me her chin resting on her hand looking at me withher large eyes from which i think tears had flowed for her face wastroubledso father she said at length you are not my father i am noones child and all that metep has said to me about my mother who diedwhen i was born is falsehas belus been speaking with you myrayes he has told me all saying you thought i ought to know now wheni am no more a little girl i wish he had been silent she addedpassionatelywhy myrabecause if i am not your daughter you will cease to love me while icannot cease to love youcertainly i shall never cease to love you while i live myra norafter perhapsher face brightenedthen all is not black as i feared for if you ceased to love meohwhat shall i call youramose when we are alone but father as of old before othersif you ceased to love meramosei think that i should die so itis and so it will ever benow i grew frightened although my heart leapt with joy at those sweetwordsperchance a day may come myra when you will learn to love someonebetter than you do menever she answered fiercelynever and she struck the table withher little hand i know what you mean do we not read of marriage inbooks and was not metep once married do not say that you wish me tomarry for i will never marry i hate all men save you and belusthey will not hate you i fearwhat does it matter what they do i have seen them it is enoughtell me quickly that you do not wish me to marryno no myra i wish that we should go on as we arealwaysah i am glad that makes me happyhere a new and dreadful thought struck her for she added with a gaspbut you might marry you whom all must love and that i could notbearbe silent foolish one i broke in i shall never marry on thatmatter i have sworn an oathoh that is good tidings yet she added slowly belus says that itis not wise to swear oaths when we are young since we seldom keepthem when we are oldlet belus be and by the gods i pray you to talk no more of marriagefor the word does not please me nor as yet is it fitting for yourlips come myra we waste time let us to the deciphering of this oldpoem that tells us of dead days and beautiful forgotten folki come ramose yet first i would say that i do remember something ofthe past of which belus spoke the shape of a tall and lovely ladywith dark hair and eyes often haunts my sleep was my mother thus anddid she ride among hosts of men clad in silveri saw her but once myra and then for a very little while in an hourof death and tumult but so she seemed to me perhaps now at times shevisits you from the underworld to watch and bless you dream on ofher myra and for the rest let it lie the gods have sent you here torejoice the world how they sent you is of no account take what thegods give you and be thankfuli am thankful she said humbly and yet with pride for whateverthey have taken away have they not given me you who saved me fromdeath and are not ashamed to love a poor maid who is no ones childthen we began our reading of the grecian poet nor did we talk againof this matter for a long while yet from that day life was a littledifferent for both of us and became more so as myra grew to full andfairest womanhood she was innocent if ever a maiden was yet naturetaught her certain things as perchance did her nurse metep pityingher motherless state therefore no longer would she throw her armabout me as we worked or press her cheek against my own but fromthat day also in some subtle fashion we became more intimate thoughthis new intimacy was one of the spirit our thoughts leapt togethertowards an unknown end soon myra discovered that i sought for morethan learning that i sought after truth or rather after god who istruth and could not find him here it was that she came to my aidperhaps because of the blood that was in her that of the hebrewsfor months we had been studying the gods of sundry nations those ofthe egyptians those of the greeks those of the babylonians andothers a search in which belus helped us much for though i think hebelieved in none of them he knew the attributes of all and theirforms of worshipat last the task was done there written on a roll were all the godsand goddesses that we could count and against each name its qualitiesand powers as its worshippers conceived these to be it was a greatlist that caused the mind to reel myra gazed at it winding up upon arod the roll which she had written in her neat letters so that godafter god departed into darkness as though time had taken them fromthe eyes of menwhat of all these i asked wearily at lengthshe made no answer but taking me by the hand led me to a windowplacewhence she drew the curtain the night was very fine and clear and theblue of the great sky was spangled with a thousand thousand starsyou see those stars she said well belus who is a greatastronomer as the babylonians have been from the beginning tells methat everyone of them is a world or perhaps a sun like our own withworlds about it now ramose you wise philosopher tell me do allthose worlds worship our multitude of gods most of them made like menor women only stronger and more evil and named gods by this littleland or that or even by this city or by thati think not i answeredthen ramose must there not be one god king of the heavens king ofthe earth whom we ought to worship taking no count of all the restthat is what the hebrews say myramy mother told you that she was a hebrew and no mean one perhapsramose this is what she teaches when she visits me in my sleepperhaps i answeredthen we passed on to other lighter matters and doubtless before sheleft me myra had forgotten all this debate which sprang suddenly fromher heart and as suddenly passed away but if she forgot iremembered and considered and accepted till in the end rejecting allelse though as yet i knew him not in my heart i became a worshipperof that one unknown god of whom she had spoken whereof all the othergods were rays in so far as they were good or perchance ministeringspiritsthus then did the maid myra find the answer to my questionings andfirst outline the faith that i hold todayoften i discussed these great matters with belus that wise man whohad sifted the truth so often that at last he came to believe innothing only smiled shook his head and answeredwhat is this one new god that you have found but he who is namedfate whose decrees i read written in the stars unchangeable from thebeginning of the worlddoes that make him less a god i askedno he answered it only gives him another name but what is godwhat is godperchance that which we search for in the heavens and at length findin our own hearts i answered   news came to cyprus and reached us very swiftly through its great oneswho were our clients thus we heard how adikran the libyan beingoppressed of the cyrenians had prayed apries my father the pharaohto help him against these greeks thereon it seemed the egyptianparty at pharaohs court forced him against his will to despatch anarmy to destroy those of cyrene as it happened however thesedefeated that army with heavy loss whereon there was a great outcryin egypt the people thinking that apries who was known to love thegreeks had made a plot that the egyptian troops should be destroyedby them then so went the tale pharaoh in his trouble turned toamasis the general under whom i had fought against the babyloniansand sent him to the army which was in rebellion to take command ofit thinking that he whom the egyptians loved would bring it toobedience yet the result was otherwise for the egyptian troopsseizing amasis set a crown upon his head and declared him pharaohthus fulfilling the prophecy of belusnow apries my father raised another great army of thirty thousandgreeks to fight amasis but in this as in all battles amasis provedhimself the better general defeating the greeks and taking apries myfather prisoner so he remained a prisoner for some years being welltreated by amasis who was kindhearted and indeed kept him to rulewith him over egypt in the end apries rebelled and departing fromsais began to raid egypt with his greeks there followed morefighting and at last apries was killed some said by the egyptiansand some by his own soldiers at least he was killed in a boat uponthe nile and amasis taking his body embalmed it and gave it royalburialthis then was the fate of pharaoh my father whom i had seen last atthat farewell feast which he gave to atyra the syrian queen yes thiswas the end of all his greatness and his gloryto be butchered like asheep in a boat upon the nile after amasis who had saved me fromdeath at his hands had cast him from his thronesuch was the news that came to us from egypt while under our feignednames we lay hid in the city of salamis in cypruswhen we were sure that the pharaoh apries who begot me was dead andthat amasis filled his throne belus spoke to me sayingis it your wish ramose to dwell here at salamis as a merchant forall your days bethink you you have no longer anything to fear fromthe wrath of him who was pharaoh for amasis sits in his place andamasis is or was your friend and minenay i answered i would return to egypt to learn whether my motherstill livesfor though we had been parted these many years i still loved mymother yet i had not dared to write to her because i feared her busytongue and lest she should whisper of my whereabouts and thus setpharaohs dogs upon my scent therefore i thought it wisest to leaveher believing that i was deadif so let us return ramose where you and myra go thither i willgo also who grow too old to seek new friends we have wealth in plentyand can live together where we willuntil my call comesi opened my lips to ask him of what call he spoke then bethinking methat he must mean that of death closed them again yet this was notso as i learned afterwardsthus in few words we agreed upon this great matter which i did themore willingly because it came to my ears that a certain high one incyprus whom it would have been hard to resist had learned of thewonderful beauty of the maid myra and was plotting to take her veryquietly we sold all that belonged to us in cyprus and transferred ourwealth to those with whom we dealt in egypt honourable men who weknew would keep it safe until we came to claim it in the trade nameof our cyprian firm though it is true that when i saw how great ithad grown i was afraidat length all was ready and the ship in which we must sail on themorrow lay at anchor at the mole we three sat somewhat desolate inour desolate home that was no longer ours for we had sold it with therest the statues the vases the gems and all the priceless treasuresthat piece by piece i had gathered to please our eyes and to make theplace beautiful were on board the vessel together with the most ofsuch of the household as had chosen to follow us so that the chamberslooked naked and unfriendly myra noted it and wept a little sayingi have been very happy here in salamis ramose and i would that wewere not going away my heart tells me that trouble awaits us yonderin egyptnow i was distressed and knew not what to answer save that regretscame too late for i could not tell her about the peril from that highlord but belus repliedit is natural that you should grieve myra who have grown frominfancy to the verge of womanhood in this place yet hearken my heartor rather the stars tell me another tale i seem to see it written onthe book of fate that whatever ills we may find in egypt those thatare worse would overtake us if we lived on here i tell you he addedsolemnly that a curse and great desolation hang over salamis whatit is i do not know mayhap it will be burned by the babylonians orother foes but unless my wisdom is at fault soon salamis thebeautiful will be no morethus he spoke nor did we question him about the matter for like allseers when belus had uttered his oracle he would not speak of itagainthe next morning before the light we embarked secretly upon our shipwhich we had given out was sailing on a trading venture and departedfrom the shores of cyprus before ever we set foot upon the quays ofmemphis we learned that a great earthquake had shaken much of salamisto the ground burying hundreds of her citizens and that among thestreets destroyed was that in which we had dwelt for a mighty wavefollowing the earthquake had flowed over it washing it into the deepwhen we heard this tale belus looked at us and smiled but we saidnothing whatever we might think                             chapter viii                              at memphisat length we came safe to memphis for apries being dead and thegrecian mercenaries and marauders who clung to him slain orscattered or driven away there was peace throughout egypt under therule of the new pharaoh amasis the egyptian the gates of the citiesstood open the nile was free to all who sailed upon it thehusbandman ploughed his field and none robbed him of its fruits inthose years before the persians fell upon her egypt rested unafraidrich and happy beneath the strong hand of amasisas soon as we came ashore in the early morn i made inquiry of a portcaptain whether tapert the high officer still dwelt there and learnedthat he had been some years dead then with secret fear but as itseemed carelessly saying that i had known him when i was a lad iasked if any of his household remained and waited with a beatingheartnay was the answer he left no children but the grecian ladylives on she whom he married and who once as she declares was thelove of apries the pharaoh indeed she remains a fair and graciouslady one of much wealth also for tapert left her all he had whichwas not a little she dwells alone in a great house in a garden notfar from the temple of ptah and is famous for her hospitality forshe spends the most of her substance on feasts and costly raimentsaying that she has none for whom to savenow when i heard that my mother lived i was glad for though the manswords showed me that she was still vain and foolish after all she wasmy mother who had given me lifeleaving the ship and its cargo in the charge of the officers appointedto watch the goods of traders and of our servants i hired assesalso a guide mounting these beasts the three of us belus and i andmyra who wore a veil in the eastern fashion to hide her face rodethrough the mean suburb that lay without the wall between the banks ofnile and the city to the gate through which we passed unquestionedthe guide led us up a broad street on either side of which dwelt therichest of the citizens till not far from the enclosure of the greattemple of ptah we came to a walled garden being admitted we rode onthrough this beautiful garden to the door of a large white house builtround a courtyard which he said was that of the widow of tapert hereservants in fine garments such as are worn in palaces ran out askingour business to whom i answered that we were strangers newly arrivedat memphis who wished to have speech with their mistress about amatter that would be of interest to her and when unsatisfied theydesired to learn our names i gave those of ptahmes and azar by whichwe had been known in cyprusa man departed with this message and presently there came an oldfellow who carried a wand which showed me that much state was kept inthis house moreover although he knew me not i knew him for when iwas a child he had been one of the servants appointed to my mother atpharaohs courtfollow me he said bowing in the fashion that he had learnt therein his youthwe follow i answered and i saw him start at the sound of my voiceand look at me curiously like one who searches his mind for somethingforgottenwe crossed the courtyard and a narrow pillared gallery by which itwas surrounded and entered a large chamber with open windowplacesthat looked towards the nile near to one of these seated in abeautiful carved chair inlaid with ivory sat a tall woman clad inwhite grecian robes engaged in stringing a necklace of gold and gemsfrom far off i knew her for my mother although now her hair wasdarker and her features thinner than they used to be there remainedthe same gracious form the same quick movement of the delicate handsand the same large grey eyes with which she glanced at us as alwayswas her wont to do at strangers that glance first fell upon me and sodwelt awhile then as though she were puzzled with a shake of thehead it passed on to belus of whom she made nothing for he wore aneastern robe with a hood to it lastly it rested upon the maiden myrawho had thrown back her veil while astonishment grew upon her facedoubtless because of the beauty that she saw it passed and shemotioned to us to be seated upon stools that had been set for us thenasked in her pleasant voicewhat is your pleasure strangers with chloe who once was great inegypt but now is known as the widow of tapert can she be of any helpto youi whispered to belus to speak because i was confusedlady he said for a certain reason we have come here travellingfrom far to ask you if you know what has chanced to a young man namedramose who was said to be the son of pharaoh now gathered to osirisas you were said to be his mothershe turned pale and let fall the necklacewho are you she asked in a cold voice that you come hither tostir up bitter memories ramose my son is dead trouble came upon himthrough a highplaced syrian harlot who bewitched him handling him assuch women do the young who take their fancy and whose death was laidat his door as though a lad would have wished to slay his lover soas i was told he fled away with a babylonian knave and sorcerercalled belus who was his tutor and used to draw horoscopes and doctorthe sick at pharaohs courtindeed be it admittedwhatever hishoroscopes may have been his doctoring was good for i have profitedby it they fled to amasis now pharaoh who at that time was generalof an army which fought and defeated the babylonians and there as ihave heard my son played a mans part in war then he vanished awayfor though the battle spared him pharaoh sought his life because ofthe highplaced syrian strumpet whose death had brought trouble uponegypt and all know what happens to those of whom pharaoh seeks thelifenow belus threw back his hood and looking at my mother askeddoes the great lady chloe find the medicine that the knave andsorcerer belus gave to her amongst others for the pain which used tostrike her in the head above the eyes still of service in the autumnof the yearmy mother sprang from her chair staring at himby zeus she cried you are belus and little changed as wouldchance with a sorcerer oh belus tell me of my son what befell myson for whom i had such high hopes if he died why are you whoshared his sin alivebecause sorcerers do not die lady replied belus drily othersdie but they live on else of what use is it to be a sorcerermy mother made no answer to his mockeries but still stared at himone thing is certain continued belus that if i am a sorcerer anda knave you are no witch but onlyforgive mea foola fool she answered angrily why sobecause a wise woman would have made certain that he whom she lovedwas truly dead before she put on the veil of mourningyour meaning she said haughtilyi have talked too much said belus ask it of these others am iyour only visitor lady chloenow for the first time my mother looked fixedly at me who was dressedin a plain merchants robe and seated in the shadow beyond the shaftof light that flowed through the window placesir she said in a hesitating voice do you know aught of thisbusiness of the death of my son who had he lived might now perhapshave been a man of your age though not i think a merchant for iwill not hide that he had royal blood in himnow i drew my stool forward out of the shadow so that the light fellfull upon my face and lifted the merchants cap from my headrevealing the brown hair that curled beneathshe stared at me oh how she staredthen muttered as though toherselfcan this be ramose whom last i saw as a lad nay it is not possiblefor had he lived ramose who loved me as a child and for whose sake itore myself away from the sight of him would never have left medesolate all these long years believing that he was dead yetthoseeyesthat hair yes and the fashion of locking his fingers ohtorment me no more are you ramose or anotheri am ramose your son i said and was silent for words choked inmy throatshe uttered a little cry then rose and threw herself upon my breastand lay there speechless in the stillness that followed i heard beluswhisper i suppose to myra who all this while had sat like a statueor perchance to himselfa fool i called her and rightly for what else is a woman who doesnot know her own sonbe quiet answered myra or i shall call you hard names belusand he obeyed her for with him myra could do what she wouldlisten my mother i said gently and reproach me no more because ihid from you that i was alive i did this knowing that if you learnedthe truth others would learn it too and soon i should cease to bealive for the ears of pharaoh are long also i was not sure till anhour ago whether you still dwelt in memphis or anywhere upon theearth therefore under a false name i lay hid in another land untili knew that pharaoh my father was dead and that i could return toegypt to seek you fearing nothing for he who now is pharaoh was myfriend and saved me from doomwho is this before whom you tell all your secrets asked my motherpointing at myra is she your wife nay she is too young yourdaughter thenaye the daughter of my heart one whom heaven sent to me who amstill unwedthen let this daughter of your heart be welcome said my motherand be sure that i shall ask no questions concerning her that you donot wish to answer yes and belus alsoof that day of reunion after many years i need write no more beforewe sat down to eat at noon our tale was told though whether my motherbelieved that part of it which had to do with the finding of myra uponthe battlefield i do not know moreover i had promised that thethree of us would take up our abode in my mothers house which waslarge and stately for she would not suffer that we should goelsewhere though from the first myra wished to do sothus began our life at memphis it was a very happy life yet it hadits troubles as have all lives first i who had been so busy a manoccupied for many hours of the day with my trading now must be idlewhich i found wearisome to remedy it having wealth at my command ibought lands near to the city and farmed them i bred cattle andhorses the finest beasts perhaps that had been seen in egypt itamed deer and wild animals and raised every kind of grain yet asthis was not enough with belus and myra i followed after alllearning till at last i was almost as wise as belus himself and myralagged not far behind meat all this my mother stared saying that poring over scrolls andcalculations was no task for a lovely maiden or for the matter ofthat for a man still young who should be busy with great affairseven my breeding of beasts did not please her for this she said wasthe business of farmers and such humble folk at length i grew vexedand asked her what she would have me do who already possessed moreriches than i needed not counting her own which were greatdo she answered why rise be a man show yourself as a high lordin egypt become famous wage wars and win them as your noble grecianforefathers would have done are you pharaohs son of the true royalblood of egypt upon the fathers side indeed as i believe his onlyson left living for amasis or his party has blotted out all therest are you not by rank a count of egypt have you not wealth atyour command as great perhaps as that of any prince or noble of egypthave you not a mother who knows the ways of courts and can help youyet you spend your days tramping amongst swamps to watch the cornspring or counting calves and foals and your nights with a maidenand a philosopher studying strange ancient books or staring at thestars so the precious years slip through your hands like water andsoon you will be old not leaving so much as one lawful child behindyou because of some silly vow you have taken that divorces you fromwomanthus my mother taunted me for she was very ambitious and as i couldsee desired that i should wipe out the stain upon my birth by risingto great station where she could glitter at my side aye she desiredmore though she never said as much in words namely that i shouldbecome pharaoh of egypt in place of one whom she called the usurperand the murderer of apries who had been her lord and my begetterfor she forgot that this father of mine had sought earnestly to put meto death because of the trouble about a syrian queen which haddisappointed him in his policies and that amasis had saved me fromhis anger but i did not forget these things and therefore would havenothing to do with such plots who indeed had no desire to becomepharaoh but sought only to lead a quiet learned life such asbefitted a man of fortune who knew that our days are short and wholooked onward to all that might lie beyond itstill to please my mother who would not let me be in peace i enteredinto the public business of the city taking this office and that andrising always to the leadership of men for nowi think through herit became known who i was none less in fact than the only living sonof the dead pharaoh also that i was one of the richest men in egyptfor which reasons i was courted not only by the common people but bythe nobles and even by the high priests of the temples of the godsfor after her vanity and ambition this was my mothers greatestfaultshe could not keep silentnow if these things were bad another was worse namely the jealousywhich sprang up between my mother and myrasince i had returned to her i was everything to my mother who wouldnever leave me if she had her way but before i returned i had beeneverything to myra who was the constant companion of my leisure hoursand who as i have said from the beginning would look upon no otherman with favour except at times on belus thus these two crossedeach others path continually till at length if i were sitting withthe one the other would not enter but departed saying she saw that idid not wish to be disturbed or some such words all of which vexedme much and caused belus to smilemeanwhile month by month myra became more learned and sweet in mindand more beautiful in face and form till at last she was the fairestmaiden that ever i beheldone day belus asked mewhy do you not marry myra ramosei started at his words and answeredhave i not told you that like a priest of isis i am sworn to remaincelibate also myra is very young and before she turns her thoughts tomarriage she should see other men young men of her own age one ofwhom perhaps she might desire as a husbandand do you desire to give her to some such strangerat this a sudden change took place in me and a pain shot through myheart it was as though it had been gripped by a cold hand it was asthough i had come face to face with deathi desire myras happiness i answered looking down i who stand inthe place of her father and mother toowould it not be well to ask her what she herself desiresi do not know perhaps when she is oldersay in a year or twomeanwhile she is happy in her state let her remain so for a whilemany things happen in a year or two said belus drilynow it would seem that this same matter of marriage was troubling mymothers mind only in another sense for having found me after manyyears of separation and being by nature somewhat jealous she did notdesire that i should marry and thus as she thought be taken awayfrom her again at any rate not yet least of all did she desire thatmyra should become my wife although she was so lovely and so learnedbecause she was sure that then one roof would not cover the three ofus however large it might be in truth it was myra whom she wished tosee wed but not to me if indeed it were lawful that i should marryher for she thought or tried to think that we who were as father anddaughter would never be happy as husband and wife also although shehad taunted me on the matter in her heart she believed that havingremained single so long it would be best that i should continue sosatisfying myself with her love and company with no other woman tocome between ustherefore she began to talk to her friends of the great charm andfavour of this ward of mine in such a way that many came to think thatshe was not my ward but my daughter as perhaps at times she didherself who wished that it might be so further she gave feasts tothe noblest of memphis at which feasts myra was present and was madeknown to the guests as my adopted daughter soon that happened whichshe had foreseenwithin a month young counts and others were seeking after myra andwithin two one of them a very fine gallant had asked her handthrough my mother who at once told myra what had chancedmyra it seemed making no answer rose and departed with angry eyesthat afternoon i was away from home checking the cattle on my farmwith my overseers the business was long and the moon was up before ireturned entering the garden of the house by a side gate as was mycustom following a winding path i came to a clump of palms the mostsecret place in all that large garden where stood seats and a tablewhich myra and i often used when we worked together in the heat of theday because there a breeze always blew beneath the roof of palmleavessuddenly a figure appeared stopping my path and i sprang back fearingthieves then the tall figure threw off its hood and the sweet voiceof myra saidramose forgive me ramose but i would speak with you alonewhat is it child cannot you always speak with me alonenay ramose not of late for in this way or in that it seems thatthe lady your mother hears all i have to say in memphis we are not aswe were at salamis the happywell speak on most dear i said seating myself upon the bench andpointing to her accustomed placeshe took it and said presentlyramose i am wretched your mother does not love me i think that sheis very jealous of me because youdo love me or did in past daystherefore she makes plots against mewhat plots i asked astonishedplots to be rid of me that she may keep you to herself ramose insecret she gives it out that i am your daughter which you tell me isnot true and that it would rejoice you to see me wed to some man ofstationhush i said child you dream it is possible that my mother mayhave thought that you were too lonely here and like other maidensdesired to be courted but for the rest i say you dreamaye ramose i dream so well that here she named one of thegreatest in memphishas asked me in marriage through herwhat of it child i said lightly he is a man well spoken ofwealthy and in the way of advancement if somewhat loudvoiced andboastful to my fancyperchance ramose yet to me he is as a crocodile or a toadnow i laughed and answeredthen say him nay and have doneaye that i will ramose but cannot you understand that there areothers behind him and that to me they are allcrocodiles and toadsthen say them all nay myra and remain as you are do you think thati wish to force you into marriageno ramose if i did i should

mood forone who is young and beautifulthen let it be strange but so it is you have sworn and it isenough for when did you ever break your word o most beloved ramosenow i would ask something else of you but having received so great agift this is not the timewhat would you ask myraoh that we might go out of this fine house to that cottage near theriver you and i and old belus and be rid of all these great folkthe women in their silks and perfumes and the lords in their chariotsor on their prancing horses with their mincing talk and false eyesand there with belus look upon the stars and hear his babylonianwisdom and his tales of the past and his prophecies of things tocome and be quite at peace forgetting and forgotten by the worldi will think of it i answered but my lady mother would be angryyour lady mother is always angrywith me but you are not angryramose and you have promised to protect me from those men so whatdoes it matter good night ramose i told your lady mother who hasmade a liar of me that i was ailing and sought my bed so thither imust go good night good night dearest ramose and she lifted herfact that i might kiss it then kissed me back and fled awayi think it was at this moment that first i began to understand that iloved myra not as a father loves his child but otherwise oh ifonly i had told her so and taken her then how many terrors should wehave missed                              chapter ix                       pharaoh comes to memphison the morning following my meeting with myra in the garden i wasawakened early by a servant who said that the head overseer of my farmdesired to see me at once i commanded that he should be brought to mychamber there the man who was so moved that he could scarcely standstill told me that a prodigy had happened during the night namelythat one of the finest of my cows had borne a splendid calf in givingbirth to which it died here he stopped as though overcome and ianswered that i grieved at the death of this cow but that the news ofit might have waited nor did i see that there was any prodigy aboutthe matterlord that is not all he went on in an awed voice the calf whichis male seems to have upon it every mark of the holy apis bull or sosays a priest of the temple who chanced to spend the night with meand has seen it indeed already he has returned to memphis to tell allthe other priests the glad and wonderful news which by tomorrow orthe next day will be known throughout egyptnow i bethought me that i wished that priest had slept anywhere savein my overseers house for something warned me that this beast inwhich i had no faith having sought a higher worship than that ofanimals whatever god the vulgar might believe them to incarnatewould bring trouble upon me but as such heresies must be hidden iasked him what the calf was like he replied that it was black asebony with a square spot of white upon its forehead and the figure ofa white hawk with outstretched wings upon its back also on its pinktonguewonder of wonderswas the figure of a scarabaeus in blacknow i affected to be much surprised and said that i would come to seethis holy calf which in my heart i hoped being so holy would soonfollow its dam to the underworld or be gored to death of its fostermother but this was not to happen for whenever it took milk the legsof that cow were tied together until it became accustomed to thechangeling also its horns were heldpresently i met belus and noting that he looked weary asked him howhe farednot too well he answered last night i consulted the starsespecially those that rule the destinies of us three and until thedawn i have been at work upon their messagewhat was it i asked idlythis ramose that because of some prodigy trouble awaits us thosestars enter an evil combination that foreshadows danger to all of usgreat danger yet be not cast down for in the end they emerge fromthis house of perils or so my calculations tell me and ride on intothat good fortune which will endure until the endnow though it is true that some of his prophecies seemed to havefulfilled themselves perhaps because these came not from stars butfrom out of the hidden wisdom of his own soul i did not believeovermuch in the divinations of belus i who always held that the greatplanets sweeping ever on their eternal journey through the skiescould scarcely trouble themselves with the petty fate of men andwomen or even influence them yet i was disturbed when he spoke of aprodigy for suddenly i remembered the birth of this apis calf and myown fears so i told belus what had chanced yonder at the farm whilehe watched the heavensnow it was his turn to be startled for he answeredi put little faith in apis who is but a priestmade symbol yetramose all the egyptians think otherwise for to them he is a godincarnate upon earth in the flesh of a bullthen may this god soon be disincarnate in heaven or elsewhere iexclaimed which was not to happen for as i have said the brutelived and throve like any common calfwhen we had eaten belus and i myra also for she would not be leftbehind whether because she wished to behold this wonder or for otherreasons mounted our asses and rode to the farm to look upon the newborn calf as soon as we were clear of the city i beheld a strangesight for the road was black with people all talking andgesticulating who too were travelling to behold the new god or theplace where it had appearedavoiding these as much as might be we came at length to the farmwhere a great crowd was gathered who were being thrust back by priests and soldiers from the shed in which the calf lay these peoplerecognised me and one cried outbehold ramose the blessed of heaven upon whose beast the spirit ofthe gods has fallen in lightning behold ramose and his beautifuldaughter for the most of them believed myra to be my daughteranother answeredaye behold him pharaohs seed who one day may himself be pharaohaye called yet another for otherwise how comes it that apis isborn in his house it is a sign it is a signso these fools clamoured till i wished that the earth would open andswallow them yes and apis tooafter this we were admitted to the shed and saw the calf which savefor its markings was as are other calves but the markings werethere and not painted and when it opened its mouth to bellow weperceived the black scarabaeus upon its tongue moreover round theshed were priests of ptah upon their knees praying and makingoblations of flowersmyra wished to go in and stroke the beast but one of these priestssprang up and dragged her back with threatening looks muttering thatit was not lawful for a woman to enter there and that if she hadescaped a curse she would be fortunateso we went home as quickly as we could and afterwards these priestsremoved the calf whither i knew not without so much as paying me itsprice to keep it until such time as it should take the place of theold apis which was so near to death that its sarcophagus was alreadyfashioned and in its niche at the buryingplace of bulls some leaguesawaywhen my mother heard the news she was much rejoicedwhen i learned that you had become a farmer my son she said itgrieved me more even than when you told me that you had been amerchant for both these trades are those of common people andunworthy of your blood which on one side is that of kings and on theother that of warriors yet now i see that in all these matters zeusor athene has directed you seeing that out of the trade you have wonmuch wealth while through the husbandry it has come about that thegreat god of the egyptians has manifested himself in your house sothat because of this you and i your mother will grow famousthroughout egyptthus spoke my mother who since she had left pharaohs household wherefor a while she was a great power had never been able to fit herselfinto the narrow bounds of private life which although she was richwere all that remained to her after the death of her husband thejudge and officer tapert continually she looked back to the pomp andceremony of pharaohs court the martial guards the blowing oftrumpets the heralds the golden furnitures the thrones and thegarments woven with the royal symbols yes and in her heart shedreamed and hoped that a day would come when through me once more shewould move amidst all this glory no longer as the mistress of theking but as his motherit was for this reason amongst others i have set out that shedesired to separate me from myra hoping that if once she were gone imight find a wife however ancient or illfavoured in whom ran somedrops of the true blood of the pharaohs of egypt therefore she setherself to make known far and wide the sign of favour which the godsof egypt had given me in the birth of an apis among my herd and as ilearned afterwards even wrote or sent messages to old friends of hersabout the court who had been servants of apries to tell them whathad come to pass and to vaunt my wealth and favour among the peoplesoon all this reached the ears of amasis who now was pharaoh andcaused him to think that it would be well if he journeyed to memphisto make an offering to the new apis or rather to the temple in whichthe beast was being reared and to the priests who guarded it also tomake sure who the man might be that was spoken of as a kings son andconcerning whom the soothsayers made prophecies for amasis neverforgot that he was a usurper who had won his throne by force of armsand had put his old master the rightful pharaoh to death or allowedhim to be slain therefore he was afraid of any one who could claimthat the true royal blood ran in his veins and knowing this i hadnot presented myself to him on my return to egyptso in the end amasis the pharaoh came to memphis sailing up nile withroyal pomp and ceremony and was received in state by the noblesofficers and people of the great cityi was amongst those who watched him land and noted that he was muchchanged from amasis the general under whom i had served and who hadsaved my life from the anger of apries years ago for time the caresof state and as some said the love of wine had whitened his hair andcarved deep lines upon his rugged face though still his eyes werepleasant if now somewhat shifty and fearhaunted as those ofusurpers who have won their thrones through blood must ever beputting aside all ceremony as of old he greeted us in his bluffsoldier fashion speaking to us not as a master or a god but as anegyptian to egyptians and calling us friends and brotherssaying too how glad he was again to visit memphis after many years andto meet its lords and peoplethen he mounted in a chariot and was conducted to the old palace ofthe pharaohs that had hastily been made ready to receive him herelater he held a court at which we of the council of the city weremade known to him one by one when my turn came for i thought itbest to appear before him boldly and he heard my name he glanced atme sharply also at belus who followed me and startedsurely count ramose and you belus the physician we have metbefore he saidyes pharaoh i answered though long years have passed sincethenis it true count ramose that apis has appeared among your herdshe askedi answered it was true that i had been so honoured of the godsagain he looked at me as though he would search my heart and inquiredwhere i livedi told him that being unwed i had made my home in the house of mymother the widow of the kings companion tapert who once wasgovernor of memphisis it so count he said then at sunset pharaoh will visit youthere without ceremony and perhaps the lady your mother and you willgive him a bite of food and a cup of wine also without ceremonyasking none to meet him save those of the householdi bowed muttering that the honour was too great whereon he waved meand belus aside and began to talk to othersas soon as we might i escaped from that court with belus and returnedhome in my chariot which i drove myself belus riding with me at thedoor i sprang out and called to the running footmen to lead away thehorsesbelus i said i am troubled why does pharaoh wish to visit methusi do not know ramose he answered looking down perhaps to talkabout apis or perhaps to speak with us of what happened when we wereyounger and the wars of long ago when he was but a general for theysay that although his memory has grown weak those days are still dearto him who can tell we shall learn in timeyes belus and i pray that it may not be more than we wish to knowthen i went in to tell my mother what had chanced she heard and brokeinto rejoicings which vexed mepharaoh coming to this house she said truly the honour is greatevery high lady in memphis will envy me i must make readyyou forget mother i said that he who comes killed him who was myfather and your lordmy lord yes who soon wearied of meone light love among manyandgave me in marriage to another man and your father yes who soughtto put you to death for small cause from which end you were saved bythis amasis wherefore i forgive him all moreover it is said that hehad naught to do with the slaying of apries whom the egyptians killedwithout his knowledge but i must be gone the time is short the timeis very short and there is much to make ready and turning she fledawaysuch is woman thought i to myself one comes who seized the throne ofher lord and her sons father and brought him to his end yet becausehe is pharaoh she rejoices as though she were about to be visited by agodand belus who had been watching nodded his head and smiled asthough he read what was passing in my mind which no doubt he didthen i retired to my own chamber and stayed there for the rest of thatday discussing problems with belus or reading histories for thehouse was in a tumult and when i sought her to continue our studieseven myra was not to be foundservants flew here and there messengers went out and returned ladenwith goods in baskets the cooks gathered to themselves other cooksand worked at their business as though their lives hung on it thesteward of the household ran to and fro cursing at all he met by thenames of evil gods the butler drew ancient wines from the cellars andtasted them until his eye grew dim and his voice thick gardenersbrought in plants and flowers that they had grown or purchased andset them about the rooms all of these things i saw through my windowplace or the halfdrawn curtains of my doorway and grew more andmore vexed and troubled at length when i was no longer able to bearthe noise and confusion and the sound of my mothers voice grownshrill and angry as she scolded the servants telling them first onething and then another i fled away to that large upper chamber of thehouse where belus slept and workedhere i found him calm as ever studying a map he had made upon apapyrus sheet of the stars or of certain of them and turning ballshung upon wires round a larger ball which he said figured the sun andthe planetsyou seem disturbed ramose he said as he checked the motion ofthese swinging ballsand you seem calm i answered angrilyyes ramose because i study the stars which are very far away andvery quiet while you study the earth which is very near and todaymore noisy than is common if you wish for quiet fix your heart uponthe stars and leave the earth aloneand what do your stars tell you belusmuch that as yet i have found no time to interpret fully but aboveall thisthat soon you and i will make a long journey i believe itis one which i have awaited many years he added slowly and in a coldvoiceover the edge of the world i asked staring at himnonot yet i think buthere the chamberlain rushed into the room and from below i heard mymothers voicemy lord he said my lord count the lady chloe says that you mustattire yourself in your best not forgetting to put on the gold chainthat the late good god who was pharaoh gave to you and all yourother marks of rankthe late good god i muttered the late good god whose throat wascut by butchers in a boat upon the nilebut who afterwards was embalmed in the best fashion wrapped in goldand buried with great glory and all his household wealth by thepresent good god which should console him for his many woesinterrupted belus mockinglythen my mothers voice rose shrilly from the foot of the stairscalling to the chamberlain who fled as presently i did also to do herbidding and array myself but as i went i saidbelus hearken search out another house for you and me and myra forhere i can dwell no more and let it be far awayi do not think there is any need answered belus i think that weshould not dwell there long because the stars have appointed one forus that is very far away still i will do your biddingas the sun began to set i went to the portico of the house followedby belus who was clad in the robes of a physician and wore the cap ofan astrologer scarcely were we come there when the sound of chariotwheels and of trampling horses told us that pharaoh was at hand thenhe appeared surrounded by a mounted guard he was arrayed as ageneral and wore no emblem of royalty save a small golden uraeus uponhis helmleaping from the chariot he ordered the officer in charge of theescort to depart with his men and return at a certain hour thenquite unattended he walked up the steps of the portico and greeted mewho stood bowing before him in his old jovial fashion and yet therewas something lacking his voice did not ring true as once it did ifelt a changesee ramose how well i trust you he said better indeed than iwould most men who might hold that they had a blood quarrel with methat is because we are old comrades in war and therefore there is abond of fellowship between us rise man rise for here we are notpharaoh and subject but two soldiers met to drink a cup of winetogetheras he spoke my mother appeared still looking fair enough though thewonderful grace and slightness of form which once were hers haddeparted from herthe lady chloe he cried catching her hand as she curtseyed lowand kissing it surely after all these years i know her again tellme lady have you made a bargain with your own aphrodite that defyingtime you remain so fair and young you whom i used to worship fromafar at the court of sais wishing to speak truth that for your sakei stood in pharaohs sandalsthus he went on bantering in his bluff fashion for never did amasislose his manners of the camp while my mother reddened to the browmuttering i know not what till of a sudden he ceased and stared pastherturning to discover at what he gazed so fixedly i saw that myra hadfollowed my mother as no doubt she had been bidden to do there shestood uncertain swaying a little like a palm in the wind myra yet anew myra for she was apparelled as to my knowledge she had neverbeen before in beautiful silken robes while round her throat andarms were fine jewels of gold and gems with necklets of large pearlsthose same priceless ornaments which were the heritage that her dyingmother had given to me in the tent upon the battlefield on her browtoo was a circlet of gold set with pearls and rising to a pointwhile ropes of pearls were twined among the waving tresses of herbrown hair which was spread like a cloud about her shoulders andalmost to her waist most beautiful she looked thus in her youngloveliness yet most splendid like to a queen indeed never beforedid i know how beautiful she was so it seemed amasis thought alsowhich was why he stared at her then askedwho is this fair maiden lady chloemyra answered my mother known as the daughter of my son ramoseand therefore a granddaughter of apries and of the royal blood ofegypt said amasis aloud but as one who thinks to himself wellshe is very fair so fair that were i a younger man i think that ishould ask her to draw near to the throne of egypt which as it is ishall not do worthy of a king she is yes worthy of a kingnow i bowed purposing to show amasis that myra was not my daughterand to repeat to him the tale of her finding upon the battlefieldwhich doubtless he had forgotten but as the first words passed mylips the curtains to the right were drawn and the chamberlainappearing between them cried out that all was readygood said amasis let us eat for know i starve whose lips havetouched nothing all this day of ceremony and taking my mother by thehand he led her into the large chamber now seldom used where taperther husband feasted the nobles when he was a high officer of memphishere a table was spread made fair with flowers and cups of gold andsilver for it had pleased tapert to collect such vessels at thecentre of this table was taperts chair of state a gilded cushionedseat that my mother had prepared for amasis in it he sat himselfwhile the rest of us stood behind himwhat he cried am i to eat alone like a prisoner in his cell notso forget i pray you my hosts that for an hour i fill pharaohsthrone and come sit at my side and let us be friendlyso we placed ourselves at the curved board my mother on his rightmyra on his left and i beyond my mother with belus beyond myrathe feast began a wonderful feast since it seemed to me that from itwas missing no luxury known in egypt indeed i wondered much how in afew short hours my mother had made so rich a preparationamasis was hungry and ate heartily praising each dish as well hemight for he could have tasted no better at his own table also hedrank without stint of the strong old wine of cyprus with whichtapert had stored his cellars and grew merrywhere have you been all these years ramose he asked i rememberthat we parted at pelusium after we had defeated evilmerodachahthat was a battle and one that went the right way for us it seems along while ago and so it is for since then merodach sat for a littlehour upon the throne of nebuchadnezzar at babylon and is gone whereverthe babylonians go when they are dead and two more after him thelast of them but a boy who reigned three months and then i think wasmurdered now nabonidus is king there chosen by the people of babylonto be their ruler they say because he hates the sight of a sword asthey have come to dowhat is known of this nabonidus pharaoh i askedto me little enough ramose except that by birth he is not royallike some other kings he added laughing and pointing to himselfmay it please pharaoh i know something of him said belus speakingfor the first time for when we both were younger i was his friendhe comes of a great house that has grown wealthy by trade his natureis or was kindly and gentle he was very fond of learning also andespecially of all that has to do with bygone kings and times andwritten records and ancient temples lately i have heard from babylonwhere there are still some who write to me that he spends his days instudying such matters and in rebuilding the old shrines of the godsleaving most of the business of the state to be dealt with by his sonthe prince belshazzarbelshazzar exclaimed amasis i have heard much of this man morethan i wish indeed what of him astrologer is he too learned andgentlenay pharaoh i knew him also in his youth when he dealt verywickedly witha friend of mine he is a fierce and cruel manambitious and violent but one of ability when he can turn from hispleasures and his wineso i have heard also and further that being an old fool nabonidustrusts all to him signing whatever his son belshazzar puts beforehim yes he does this even at a time when babylon is threatened bycyrus the persian therefore through his councillors and in the nameof nabonidus the king belshazzar seeks an alliance with egypt uponwhom nebuchadnezzar was wont to war as we know in earnest of it heoffers his sister in marriage to me and asks that a princess of theroyal house of egypt should be given to his father nabonidus who islately widowed that she may be queen of babylon and all its empireand take with her as a dowry the friendship of egypthere he paused to drink wine then added more as though he werespeaking to himself than to usbut i have no princess to send to him and apries who went before meleft no daughters save one who is already married old and childlessfor whom even the ancient nabonidus would not thank methen again he paused looking about him his eyes fell upon myra whowas seated by him leaning forward so that she might hear allbeautiful he muttered most beautifula thought seemed to strike him for he started then began to talk tomyra asking her of her life at memphis and whether it would notplease her to shine in a kings courtnay o pharaoh she answered i am very happy here where i followafter learning with belus for my teacher and for the rest occupymyself with simple thingswhat do you learn maiden asked amasis the languages of otherlandsyes replied myra with pride i know greek and the tongues ofcyprus that of babylon also and can write them allthoth god of letters led by the hand of hathor and bes gods oflove and beauty must have attended at your birth maiden exclaimedamasis in the voice of one who had drunk too much as leaning forwardhe patted her on the handnow i looked at my mother who fearing some folly on the part ofpharaoh and understanding that i wished her to be gone rose from herseat bowed and departed taking myra with her amasis waited till thecurtains had swung to behind them then he looked round the room andseeing that we were alone for at a sign from me the servants had leftus of a sudden he seemed to grow sober as i remembered he couldalways do if he wishedramose he said now that the women have left us i would have aword with you which was why i came here nay belus do not go it isalways well to have a waterdrinker for a witnessi bowed and waitedramose he went on if i were wise i think that i should cause youto be killedthat pharaoh cannot do i said having eaten of my bread yet whyshould he cause me to be killed whom in the past he saved from deathbecause times have changed and we change with them ramose becausewithout doubt you are of the old royal blood of egypt if on one sideonly whereas not a drop of it flows in my veins and but little inthose of my sons for those wives of mine who are called royal weremade so by decree rather than by birth because too this is knownamong the people who as my spies have told me treat you like aprince and in their private talk speak of you as one who in a day tocome may sit in pharaohs seat lastly because an apis has been bornamong your cattle which the vulgar take for a sign yes and thepriests who are the real power in egypt certainly therefore it wouldbe wiser that you should die or so i think who desire to be theforefather of a great dynasty that shall rule for hundreds of yearsi am in pharaohs hands i answered coldly he has thousands at hiscommand to do his will whereas i am defenceless if pharaoh desiresto mingle my blood with my wine what more is there to say let himwho slew the father slay the son and make an endnow whether by design or because it was so again suddenly amasisseemed to grow drunken and answeredaye why not it would save many doubts and troubles belus here willbear witness that we quarrelled and that i killed you in selfdefence and rising he halfdrew the sword which he wore with hisgenerals armourbelus sprang up and slipping behind amasis began to talk into hisear although he spoke so low all he said or the meaning of it cameto my sense made keen by danger it went thuspharaoh forgets that in this quiet place his armies avail himnothing here he can die like other men let him lookamasis glanced over his shoulder to see that there was a knife in thehand of belus and that its point was very near his throatif pharaoh died went on belus would it not be easy to hide himaway while some went out and declared that he had been gathered toosiris and that the gods who had caused apis to be born in his househad appointed ramose the son of apries to fill his throne and ifthis were done would not memphis listen and what memphis says wouldnot all egypt say and would not the army welcome ramose with ashoutperhaps you are right said amasis again sobered of a suddenramose know that i do not wish to kill you if only i can be surethat you will not plot against me believe me neither did i wish tokill your father after the army had made me king yonder in cyreniaand against my will i kept him to rule with me but he plottedagainst me and at last came the end they tell me that you are doinglikewise and now apis has been born amongst your herds which egyptwill take for a sign if i spare you how can i be certain that youwill spare mebecause i have no wish to sit upon any throne pharaoh i who havingenough to satisfy my every want desire only to lead a peacefullearned life is it my fault that an apis is born amongst my herdno ramose but it is a sign sent by the gods at least the peoplewill so interpret it and therefore you must bear the blame for therest you may change your mind i had no wish to be a king yet acrown was thrust upon me which could not have happened if apries hadkilled me first as had he been wise he would have done still as alad you were ever honest so asking no oaths i believe you for whatare oaths when it comes to grips indeed what i said was but to tryyou so let it be forgotten yet belus has threatened me with a knifewhy then should he not die he the threatener of pharaoh who as anypriest will tell you is a godno lessnow belus showing no fear answered boldlyi think that i answered that question long ago pharaoh in a certaingenerals tent upon the borders of egypt before a great battleagainst the babyloniansi remember said amasis you said the stars appointed me to be kingwhich has come true though at the time the words seemed folly andhe looked at him not without awei said more than that pharaoh as my life seemed to be in dangerthen as it does now i told you that those stars declared also thatif you killed me my blood would call for your blood and that you toowould die i repeat those words for the stars do not change theirstory if you are weary of life and rule strive to bring death uponme who never harmed youamasis stared at him and his ruddy face grew palei think that you have power babylonian he said if of a differentsort from mine fear nothing you shall go safe from me and yourmaster also so long as he does not try to plot against me or to takemy placepharaoh is very wise answered belus in the same cold voice sowise that i will tell him something that i wished to keep secretalready by his threats he has earned much evil at the hand of fatewhat evil manthisthat though he live out his life in peace and splendour yet itshall not be so with him who comes after the son of his body stormclouds are gathering in the east o pharaohhave done babylonian broke in amasis i would hear no more ofyour evilopened talk our pact is madeit is enoughas pharaoh pleases said belus bowing while with quick eyes hesearched his facethen amasis turned to me and askedwhat happened to you after we parted years ago ramose i rememberthat you went away with a little child about whom you told some idletale but who in truth was your daughter that same maiden who dwellswith you todayshe was not my daughter pharaohthus i began but he stopped me with a wave of his hand and his roughsoldiers laugh sayingoh deny it not ramose have we not all heard of you and thatbeautiful syrian queen a very flower of love whose favour you had theluck to win as a lad though you brought her none did not the wholecamp believe that the child was your daughter born of this queen oranother woman perchance whom you carried with you from egypt to saveher from the syrians and is she not proclaimed here as your daughterby your own mother and all in memphis yes your daughter and thegrandchild of apries as indeed may be read in her royal air so angerme no more with your denials as though i were a priest to whom youmust plead purity for i will not listen to them who hate liars tellme what chanced to you after you escaped from the wrath of apriesyour fatherthen thinking it wiser not to cross his wild uncertain mood which iset down to the wine that he had drunk over this matter small as iheld it i told amasis how i had journeyed to cyprus and made my homethere and grown rich by tradeand why did you not stay in cyprus ramose he asked suspiciouslybecause i desired to see my mother from whom i had been parted formany years and being egyptian born to dwell in egypt where ibelieved that now i should be safe as pharaohs friend also beluswarned me that disaster was about to fall upon the city where wedwelt which indeed happened for after i had left it salamis wasshaken to the ground by earthquake and those who dwelt in the housethat had been mine were crushedbelus again exclaimed amasis by the gods i would take him for mysoothsayer were i not sure that of me he would always prophesy moreill than good and being a physician also could bring it to pass ifso he chose therefore i leave you belus praying you to guard himwell who swears or so i understand that his death and mine will notbe far apart to tell the truth i have no fancy to see osiris out ofhis wrappings before i must or to chat with apries and others at histable no no keep belus and live at ease ramose even if your cowsbear an apis once a year and be sure of pharaohs favour and all thathe can give you so long as you leave pharaoh in peace and now thatwe have settled these matters let us drink a last cup together inpledge of them ramose of whom i purpose to make a viceroy in kush orelsewhere or perchance to send upon an embassy for you are one whoshould be great in war and council and not spend your life inbreeding beasts and growing grain like any mudborn thickhead whocalls himself a noble and to prove it flogs his slaves yes one whoshould serve pharaoh and prop up his throne to his vantage and yourownthen having drunk as belus and i pretended to do also he set downhis cup and walked with us somewhat unsteadily to the chamber wheremy mother sat here at the doorway he bade belus and myself discoverwhether his escort was in attendance and if not to wait till it cameand then advise him who meanwhile would talk with my mother and bidher farewellso we went because we must for in such matters pharaoh must not bedisobeyed and for a long while tarried in the porch at length theescort came and with it the chariot of pharaohwe returned to make report the curtains were drawn over the entranceof my mothers sitting chamber thrusting them apart i saw her seatedon a couch with amasis at her side he was leaning forward talkinginto her ear while from time to time she nodded her head as thoughin ascent perceiving me between the curtains she laid her fingers onher lips as though to teach him silence then rose calling to me toenter i did so and bowing to pharaoh told him that his guard andchariot waited on his pleasureso much the worse he grumbled seeing that now after some happyhours in the fellowship of old comrades and fair ladies like an oxharnessed to a watermill i must get me to my work again see nowwhat it is there is the matter of the repair or rebuilding of thesetemples of memphis to be considered for it must be done cost what itmay to please the priestsi mean the gods with whom no pharaoh darebe out of favour i am minded to put you in charge of that businessramose because having been a merchant as well as a learned man and alover of what is beautiful you would save me from being cheated byroguish architects and craftsmen next i must up nile to abydos totend the ruined shrines of osiris and thence to thebes on a likeerrand also to make offerings at the sepulchres of the ancient kingsthough where their mummies may be today none knows for thieves havebeen at work with all of them then back here again perchance to buryapis that they say is dying with fitting pomp yonder in the desertwhere those gods lie after that away to sais to deal with matters ofstate and to face the eternal babylonian trouble to say nothing ofthat of the persians as best i can as well as the quarrels of thewomen of my own household which will pursue me as i think to theunderworldoh who would be a pharaoh ramose be guided by me i pray you andnever seek to be a pharaoh even should a mother urge it in your earsthough this i am sure the lady chloe being wise would never do nowfarewell to all of you and not least my hostess to that fairgrandchild of yours ramoses daughter whose beauty were it seenwould set the world aflame and lift her to a throne farewell myhosts and farewell too belus shepherd of the stars or by themshepherdedi know not which belus the farsighted to whom the godsunveil and who handles wisdom as a soldier does his knifeor ratherwho handles both wisdomand a knife farewell all ho slavessummon the officers to conduct pharaoh to his chariotthus amasis came and thus bewildering us and hiding his purposeswith this long rambling speech as dust obscures a chariot he wentfrom my mothers house at memphis when he had staggered down thesteps and departed belus and i looked at each other saying nothingthen i turned to seek my mother but she too had gone                              chapter x                           the happy housewith pomp and ceremony pharaoh amasis departed up nile to thebes yetere he went he laid various offices on me as one marked for hisespecial favour high offices not to be refused to fill which i musttake public oaths swearing by the gods to be faithful to him and hishouse under pain of death and the curse of heaven also he appointedme as overseer of the architects employed upon the rebuilding ofsundry temples and especially of the great shrine of ptah in memphisthus it came about that soon i must work from dawn till dark as neveri had worked before scarcely finding leisure to eat much less toread with myra or even to talk with her of whom now i saw but littlewhen i met my mother however which was not often for i was outbefore she rose and for the most part returned only after she hadsought her bed i noted a change in her she seemed to be full ofmystery and to follow more than ever after foolish pomps seatingherself in a chair that was like to a throne with servants who heldfans standing behind her and even wearing marks of royalty when therewere no strangers there to see such as a circlet of gold upon herhead from which rose the uraeus snakethe sight of this angered me so much that at last i asked her sharplywhat it meant and if she wished to bring trouble on me by aping arank that was not hersnot so she answered smiling yet may not she who has borne a sonto him who was pharaoh bear the mark of royalty that is when she hasspecial leave so to do from him who is pharaohi do not know what you mean my mother but i do know that if thiswere the law there would be many women in egypt wearing the royaluraeus i answered bluntly adding i pray you therefore to lay thatornament aside lest my head should pay the price of what you set uponyour ownthen growing angry she rose and left me as one who might answer butwho would not nor did she appear again before me adorned likepharaohs queen or daughter indeed i saw her but seldom and when wemet she would rarely speak to meon a certain feast day that appointed to some god when none labouredbelus saidyou bade me buy you a house and i have done so out of your moneys inmy hands for i trusted all my wealth to belus also with the helpof myra i have furnished it come now and look upon your new homedoes my mother know of this i asked astonishedi have not told her he answered yet i think she guesses at leastshe said to me but yesterday that perhaps it was as well that youshould live apart because you no longer agreed together moreover sheheld it that it would be more fitting to your new dignities that youshould have a dwelling of your ownso i went to see this new abode and found it very beautiful it was anold palace outside the great wall of the city and thereforesurrounded by a large garden of which because of the narrow spacethere were few within the wall in the ancient days when the pharaohslived at memphis this palace it was said had been that of the heirof the king in later times however it had become a privatedwelling also a home of priests but now for a generation save forcaretakers it had been deserted though still used as a storehouse sothat the roof and walls were saved from decay further the gardenshad been hired to a husbandman who grew in them fruit and vegetablesfor sale in the city also beneath the palm trees green barley forfoddernow all this had passed by purchase to me and already belus havingall my revenues at his command had set numbers of the best artificersand artists in memphis to work to make the place beautiful and oncemore a fitting home for a great noble or a prince moreover myra wasin the secret and throwing her heart into the business labouredjoyously that our new homefor never for a moment did she doubt thatit would be hers as well as mineshould be made even fairer than thatat salamis one of the most perfect indeed in all egyptto this end all the furnishings which i had brought from cyprus thestatues the inlaid and enamelled chests the chairs and beds thevessels of gold and silver and i know not what besides which foryears it had been my pleasure to collect as the choicest wares andexamples of ancient art from syria cyprus and egypt were gatheredfrom the places where they had been stored because my mothers housewould not contain them here and there myra said they should standeven before the rooms were ready to receive them so that they must becovered up with cloths for fear of damage by the artists and theplasterersalso through belus who was foolish where she was concerned and likeher old nurse metep unable to withstand her smallest fancy myrabought in memphis the loveliest that it had to sell of hangings andcarpets and couches and silver swinging lamps all of which she setabout the chambers especially in those that were to be allotted tome yet when i entered her own i found it with bare walls and butplainly furnished a low bed of white wood some stools and chairswith feet shaped like to those of antelopes also of white wood andhideseated and three chests to hold her garments painted withscenes of wildfowl disporting themselves among lotus plants orrushing in alarm through papyrus reedshow is this i asked my chamber is as that of pharaoh while yoursmight be the sleepingplace of the daughter of a village sheikbecause i would have it so she answered tossing her headmoreover in time to come the walls shall be painted when i havefinished the design and belus can find an artist who is not a fooli have found one said beluswho is that artist she askedyourself belus answered laughing drily then turned and fledbefore she could scold himindeed i was the only one who did not laugh over all this businesswhen in the end i found that it had cost me the quarter of my fortuneno lesswhat does it matter said belus in reply to my complaining whatdoes anything matter especially when there is plenty left whichgathers day by day that is if it pleases myrayou are right i said nothing matters if it pleases myra now shewill have little left for which to wishi am not so sure said belus and went away before i could ask himwhat he meantat length we took up our abode in this fine new home although as yetit was far from finished my mother came to view it borne in a chairsuch as was used by a wife of pharaoh when she went abroad and whenshe discovered that all had been planned by myra found much faultwith every thing saying that i should have done better to be guidedby her own purer grecian tastesstill she added the place is fine and the furnishings anddecorations are of small account for when your daughter myra leavesit to become the consort of some mighty man they can be changedi do not understand you my mother i answered myra does not wishto change her state also she is not my daughterthen ramose if she is not your daughter why is she not your wifesurely you would make nothing less of herhaving shot this bitter arrow she went away without waiting for ananswerwhat does she mean i asked of belus who had heard these wordswhat she says or so i think hearken ramose there is some plotafoot i know not what it is but it has to do with myra if you wouldkeep her at your side ramose let it be as your wife remember thatyour mother is right if you give it out that she is not your daughterand she continues to dwell in your house with no other woman save anold nurse although you forget it because she has lived with you froma babe you will cast a slur upon her namenow hearing this i was much disturbedare you mad belus i asked have we three not always livedtogether and for the rest is it fitting that i who am almost oldenough to be her father and who for years have forsworn women shouldwed this young maidwould it then grieve you so much to take her was a wife ramoseasked belus in his quiet fashionnow i felt the blood come to my face as i answeredit would not grieve me at all to tell the truth it would delight memore than anything on earth it was not of myself that i thought butof the poor child who if i spoke to her of marriage with me wouldtake it as a command and obey because she held it to be her duty forthat reason abandoning all hope of a husband of her own yearsi thought that not so long ago she might have pleased herself in thismatter and would not ramoseit is true but because a woman turns from one man it does not followthat she turns from all after all that count was an emptyheadedcoxcomb there are better than he in memphisit is a strange thing ramose that those who are wise in ninematters are often foolish in the tenth and those whose sight is sokeen that it can note a lizard on a housetop often cannot discern thepitfall that yawns before their feet or the sharp stone that willlame them such i hold is your case ramose now i pray you if youhave any faith in what you call my foresight and my vision put thismatter to the proof and show me that i am wronghow belusby asking myra whether or not it would please her to become yourwife ask her and soon tomorrow pharaoh returns from thebes to burythe apis that is dead and then passes on at once to saiswhat has that to do with myra and myself i asked angrily becauseto tell the truth i knew that belus never spoke without reason wordsthat from another would signify little or nothing on his lips werefull of meaningmore than you think perhaps ramose he replied addingdo you promise to prove that i am wrong if you can not next yearor next moon but this very dayyes that is how can i who must go at once to attend to matters inthe city that cannot be postponedyou return to supper i believe and after supper it is customary formyra and you to read together do you promiseto please you i promise though i do not know why you should force meto give myra pain and to bring shame upon myselfperhaps ere long you will find out however you have promised and itis enough for when did you ever break your word ramosethen he went leaving me wondering where i had heard those wordsbefore ah it came back to mefrom the lips of myra herself afterthat boastful fop had asked her in marriage and she had made me swearthat i would protect her from all men how came it then that these twospoke as with one voice had they agreed together to ply me with thesame flattery nay that was not in the nature of either of them theydid but say what they believed they had set me a man full ofweakness and of failings like a statue upon a pylon or a pyramid oneto be admired as higher than others one to be loved more than othersthis i could understand in the case of belus who with all his learningand gifts from heaven was but a fond philosopher who being childlessand with few friends in his exile had cherished me from my boyhoodbut what of myra who knew all my faults and follies and must sufferfrom my moods could it be that there was something in her heart whichcaused her to forgive these many imperfections and to gild my claywith the gold of love i did not know but as i had promised belus iwould discover the truth before i slept that night oh if it shouldprove that this sweetest of all maidens loved me not as a child lovesher father but as a woman loves a man then how blessed would be mylot nay it was too much to hope and i must be on my guard i mustwatch lest her kind heart duty and a desire to please should put onthe mask of lovei went about my business which was very urgent for much must be madeready before pharaoh returned upon the morrow asking account of mylabours under his royal commission all day i worked in the heat ofthe sun much vexed with those that had failed me and with thefoolishness of a selfwilled architect and at last as it sankwearied out was borne to my new homehere i bathed and clad myself in clean garments of linen then led bya servant i went to the eatingchamber a very fine room where oncethe royal princes of old egypt had banqueted with their friends andwomen that now cleaned and repaired we used for the first time thisapartment of which the walls were painted with scenes of feasting andof gay sports somewhat faded perhaps seeing that the artist wholimned them had been dead for hundreds upon hundreds of years openedon to a gallery that looked over the gardens and the intervening landsdown upon the distant nile from this gallery or portico the room wasseparated by painted columns formed of heads of hathor goddess oflove between which columns hung rich curtains that the furnishers hadplaced there only that day those that pharaohs sons had used havingrotted many generations gonein the centre of this beautiful room illumined by hanging lamps thatwe had brought with us from cyprus myra had set a table of black woodinlaid with electrum and on it cups of gold and silver taken from mystore and alabaster vases filled with flowers here at this fairtable i ate my first meal in that house belus sitting at one side ofit and i at its head at its foot in the place of the lady of thehouse was myra who in honour of this event had been pleased to arrayherself in her richest garments and ornaments such as she had worn atthe feast my mother had given to pharaoh thus with the lamplightfalling on her she looked beautiful indeed i think the most beautifulwoman that ever i saw except perhaps atyra whose loveliness was of aricher order and more matured it was strange to see that this atyrasmemory should rise up and refuse to leave me on that night when i didnot desire its fellowship yet it was so had her spirit been standingat my side like the double watching in a tomb she could not havebeen more presentmyra was in her merriest mood she laughed and talked and jested tillat length i asked what made her so joyousoh many things ramose she answered but chiefly because tonighti am like a slave whose fetters have been struck off and whose lordhas granted her freedomwhen did you wear fetters myratill yesterday ramose yonder in your mothers house where thoughyou knew it not i was always watched here i am freefree belusfirst of prophets be kind use your skill belus and tell me myfortune here is water into which you may gaze without are starsthat is unless the moon has devoured them here is my hand coveredwith a hundred tiny lines gaze into the water read the stars and thebirthwritings stamped upon my flesh and tell me my fortune tell methat i shall have many years of joy in this place do you know whatwas its ancient name i have discovered it from an old man who worksin the garden who had it from his grandfather it was called the happyhouse in the byegone days when it was the home of princes and greatlords tell me that it will be the happy house for me and for ramoseand for you too dear belusnow belus shook his head saying that his arts were needless becauseher words had already fulfilled her wish still she would not let himbe but went on teasing him till at length he saidgive me that little lily you wear upon your breast o foolish maidwho cannot be content with the hour and its joysshe obeyed he took the fair white lily warm from her bosom and castit into a bowl of richhued glass that was filled with water for thedipping of hands when the meals were done muttered some words that icould not understand and breathed upon it after which he watched itfor a long while now growing uneasy for i shrank from this jest whodoubted whether belus could play the conjurer even when he tried hewho was filled with so strange and true a wisdom i rose and lookedover his shoulder into the bowlthere was the lily floating but as i watched it seemed to lose itsshape as though it had been grasped and crumpled its whiteness alsothe water too though this may have been fancy or because of thecolour of the red eastern glass to my sight grew first to the hue ofwine and then to that of blood so that suddenly i remembered theblood of murdered atyra that lay beneath the robe upon the floor ofher chamber at sais and shiveredi glanced at the face of belus and noted that it was not that of onewho played a trick to please a girl nay it was strained and anxiousand on his brow appeared beads of sudden sweat i was about to speakor overthrow the bowl but divining it although i stood behind him heheld up a finger and checked me for a minute or more he went onwatching covering the most of the bowl with his hands so that icould no longer see within it then his face changed and once morebecame quiet and impenetrable also he sighed a sigh of relief suchas is uttered when a great danger has passed by ourselves or one weloveremoving his hands from the edge of the bowl he saidlooki did so and behold there floated the little lily as white as it hadbeen when it was gathered in water as pure as when it was drawn fromthe well he took the flower and gave it back to myra sayingpress it in a book child and cherish it all your life nay set itbetween two plates of crystal as a talismanoh my lily she cried how fair you are and how sweet you smellalthough so small your fragrance perfumes the room ramose you shallmake me a present you shall order the jeweller to enclose this littlelily in a tiny shrine of crystal hung upon a golden chain such as ican always wear that is you shall do this tomorrow tonight i willkeep it for myself but i forget what did my magic flower tell youbelus nay do not shake your head speak i command you and trulyin the name of the truth we worship speak trulybeing thus adjured it seems that i must obey said belus slowlyyour magic lily told me that your wish will be fulfilled and that inthis abode which is named the happy house you will spend many years ofsuch joy as is given to those who wander upon earthshe clapped her hands rejoicingthose are good words she laughed those are most fortunate wordsyes myra they are good and fortunate wherefore forget them notwhen good fortune seems far away you have not heard the end of themmyra which since you commanded me to speak all the truth i mustdeclare to you between this night of joy and those years of joy tocome lies a space of fear and black doubt such as crushes the heartsof mortals steel yourself to bear them myra as others must who loveyou as i did but now when i saw the white lily blacken in the cup andthe water on which it floated turn to a pool of blood rememberalways even when hope seems gone that the lily will once more growwhite and fragrant and the water once more be purei will remember she answered quietly and very gravely who suddenlyunderstood that this was no childs game but something that thestrength of belus had wrung out of the clenched hand of fatesomething she could not understand and perhaps that he himself didnot altogether understandbelus rose and went the servants came and did their office swiftlyenough who were well trained having been with me in cyprus leavingus alonethe place is hot i said nor can we go to the chamber chosen forour studies for it is not prepared all is in confusion there comemyra let us sit without and watch the moon rise up on the nileyes she said and led the way between the curtains to the porticoor colonnade that was built along that front of the old palace whichfaced towards the nile here were ancient marble seats and on one ofthese that nearest to the corner of the house where a wall was builtacross the roofedin colonnade we sat ourselves down in the shadowwhat did belus mean ramose she asked awaking from her silencedo you believe in these prophecies of hisi am not sure myra sometimes i believe and sometimes i do notcertainly some of them seem to have come true but this may be bychance for a wise physician who watches all things and has greatknowledge of the hearts of men cannot always read the future wrongwhether or not the stars reveal it to him at least this last oracleof his is one of good omen so let us accept it and be contenti am content ramose now that we three are alone together as we werein cyprus yonder i was not for it seemed to me there in yourmothers house i was like a bird in a cage or one about whom a netwas being drawnwhy should my mother wish to play the spider to you i askeddisturbedi do not know ramose perhaps because she is jealous of me perhapsbecause she wishes to use me who am called your daughteralways oflate she speaks of me as your daughter when there are any to listenas she did to pharaohto advance your fortunes and her own i say ido not know but believe me so it was also that at the last shewould have prevented me from coming here aye and might have done sohad it not been for metep who outwitted her how i will not tell younow for the tale is long it is enough that tonight at last i am freeand once more with you and belus as we were at salamis yet i prayyou ramose set a guard about this house that free i may remain andnear to youdo you then desire always to remain near to me myraaye ramoseyou know that you are not my daughter myra and indeed no kin ofmine whatever my mother or others may sayaye ramose i know itdo you know also myra that it is hard for a man to dwell with sucha one as you are who is not his daughter and not to wish that shewere even more than his daughter yes that it is very hard though itmay chance that in years he might almost be her fathermyra sat up upon the seat gripping the edge of it with her hands andglancing at me sideways which things i could see in the twilightwhy is it hard what do you mean ramose she asked in a low voiceas she spoke the great moon appeared from a bank of cloud her raysmaking a path of silver across the broad waters of the nile and thecultivated land flooding the pillared portico and striking upon thebeautiful girl who sat at my side her beast heaving her lips partedi gazed at her and of a sudden passion took hold of me yes passionin its strength and i knew that above all earthly things i desiredher no longer as a daughter and a friend but as my wife yes to beall my owni mean myra i answered i mean that i love youthis you have always done ramoseaye but now i love you in another fashion do you not understandi think i understand ramosei suppose that it has been so for long myra but to be plain i havebeen ashamed to tell you so who was a man grown when you were but ababe i have feared myra lest if i did you should hold it to beyour duty to give yourself to me not because of the hunger of yourheart but because it was i who asked it of you to me a man whosehair begins to grow grey upon his templesshe smiled a little the moonlight showed it a somewhat mysterioussmile such as is to be seen upon the carven faces of sphinxes whichtold of secret thoughts hidden behind her eyesyou who are so wise in some ways were ever foolish ramose sheanswered and once more was silent words that left me wonderingthough in substance they did but repeat what belus had said thatmorningthrice i tried to speak and thrice i failed while still she watchedme with that dreaming smile upon her face at last in poor baldsyllables the common question broke from my lipsmyra though i have seen some eight and thirty summers can you loveme as your husbandvery slowly she turned her head and now i saw that her cheeks glowedand that her wonderful dark eyes swam with tears she strove to answerand in turn failed then she took another road sinking upon my heartand lifting her lips towards my ownit was done my arms were about her her head rested on my shoulderoh ramose she sobbed for all these years since i became womanhow could you be so blind                              chapter xi                          the burial of apisof the rest of what passed between myra and myself upon that night ofjoy nothing need be told by degrees stripped of all the trappingswith which we mortals veil the truth our love stood revealed inperfect beauty it seemed that ever since she had come to womanhoodmyra had desired to be to me all that woman can to man and yet had sohid her secret that i guessed it not it seemed too that as sheloved me so i had loved her and yet had buried that love beneath ahill of forms and selfdeceiving falsehoods pretending that i lookedupon her only as a daughter and a ward given to me of heaven but nowthe screens were down and behind them pure and beautiful appearedthe naked truthat last we parted but not before it was agreed between us that wewould be wed at once on the morrow if it might be though this wasdoubtful because for such a marriage formalities were neededespecially in the case of a man like myself upon whom many eyes wereset a man in whose veins royal blood was known to run moreover shewho was to be my bride had been commonly reputed to be my daughter andas to this the truth must be registered by all of us before certainpublic officers and in particular by myself by belus and by the oldnurse metep which matters would take timein truth they took longer than i thought for stir as i would in thebusiness three days went by before all was completed because thosewho had to deal with them deemed it necessary to obtain the seal of acertain officer acknowledging that myra was my ward which officer wasabsent from memphisi have named that night of betrothal and revelation a night of joyyet it was not altogether so for the reason that nothing can be quiteperfect on the earth at length all was finished we had told ourtales our last kiss was given and myra had glided away to herchamber turning again and again to look upon me i stood alone in theportico leaning against a column and gazing upon the glory of the fullmoon shining over nile of what did it remind me suddenly iremembered it reminded me of just such a night as this when longyears ago i and another woman seated amid ruined columns had lookedupon the moon shining over nile and beneath her beams had kissed andclung a shadow passed before me and to my strained sense almost itseemed as though it were the wraith of atyra considering me withreproachful eyesif so why should she reproach me who for all these years because ofher had stood apart from woman she who drew me into trouble when iwas but a lad and perished through the fierce jealousy of herministersoh this was foolishness yet the folly wore a cloak of fear what ifthe new love told beneath the moon looking down on nile should alsoend in blood and terror as did the old love told beneath the moonlooking down on that same nile nay belus had prophesied that itwould not be so and i put faith in belus yet there the shadow movednot beyond the columns but in my heart a shadow shaped of memoriesthe forms were filled the priestlawyer from the temple of thoth hadwritten the marriage contract whereunder i settled the half of all ihad on myra everything was prepared and myra had left me as she hadno parents or other relatives from whom i could come to claim her as abride according to custom in case of maidens of high birth she hadbeen conducted with her woman metep the old nurse to the temple ofhathor where she would spend the night in the care of priestesseshere it was agreed i must present myself at sunrise upon thefollowing morning to name her my wife before the altar of hathor andin the presence of the servants of the goddessshe parted from me somewhat disturbed reminding me that since she wasan infant she had never slept away from the shelter of my roof savewhen we were together upon a ship or in my mothers house which wasalso my own and that it seemed to her an evil thing that she shoulddo so nowi laughed away her fears answering that on the morrow she wouldreturn and that thenceforward we should be together until deathwhen myra had gone i bethought me that i must ask my mother to bepresent at our marriage indeed it had been my wish to speak to her ofthis matter before but when i said as much to myra she prayed me notto do so in such an earnest fashion that i let the business be forthe same reason i dismissed the thought which had come to me thatinstead of sleeping at the temple of hathor myra should pass thenight before our marriage at my mothers house yet now when she hadgone to the temple in charge of the priestesses to that house i wentknowing that it would seem strange if my mother were not present atthe ceremony also that she would be angry if she were not asked andthink that myra had wished to affront hercoming to the house i entered for the door was open and wentstraight to the large chamber where my mother always sat it wasempty nor could i find her in any other room thinking that she mustbe in the garden i set out to search for her there and on my way metan old woman who had been her servant for many years from the timeindeed when she dwelt at the court of pharaoh apries my fatherwhere is the lady chloe and where is everybody i askedoh my lord ramose she answered i do not know where they are nowbut some days ago the lady chloe and the most of the household wentaway up nile in a big boat or perhaps they went in two boatsup nile when and what fori cant quite remember when lord ramose for now that i am old mymemory grows weak but it may have been two days or three no ithink that it was four as to why they went i am not certain but itmust have been for a great reason because they were all so finelydressed the lady chloe my mistress in beautiful clothes such asshe used to wear at the court of sais also the jewels and chains thatpharaoh apries gave to her oh she looked fine lord ramose so finethat it rejoiced my heart to see her and made me think of the gooddays when she was the loveliest lady of the court and pharaoh used tokiss her hand yes and her lips alsohave done i said angrily why did my mother go up nile tell meold fool or it shall be the worse for yoube not wrath lord she said shrinking from me as though she fearedthat i might strike her i am but a slave who must do the bidding ofmy mistress and keep her secrets lest it should be the worse for menay woman you must do my bidding the truth now or you go to thosewho know how to wring it from youlord she said in a great fright i will tell all i know it is butlittle two mornings ago the lady chloe and her servants sailed upnile to meet pharaoh who had summoned her and sent barges to conveyher to him why she went to meet pharaoh i could not tell you thoughyou were to beat me with rods till i diedwhen i saw that she knew no more i left her and sought out otherservants of my mothers on whom i wasted much time in uselessquestionings for these seemed to know even less than did the oldwoman so at last weary and perplexed i returned home and findingbelus told him all i had learned asking him if he could understandits meaningit seems plain he answered your mother has gone to meet pharaohby appointment and to discuss certain private matters but what thesemay be is known to the gods alonestill can you guess them belusyes i can guess that they have to do with myra remember ramosethat it still pleases both your mother and pharaoh to talk of myra asyour daughterif so what of itonly this that then she is one who can be given in marriagenot so belus at least if she were my daughter i alone could giveher in marriagepharaoh is the father of all and can give any in marriage to whom hewill answered belus darklythen he thought a while and added save those who are alreadymarried as myra will be tomorrow i would that it had been todayor better still a year gone so that she held an infant in her armsin this matter ramose you have been too slow and lost time cannot befound again still fret not for tomorrow all will be rightedthen upon some pretext or other he left me as i felt sure because hedid not wish to talk more of this matter often since that day i havewondered how much belus knew or guessed of the calamity that overhungusi slept but ill that night for the shadow of this unknown calamitylay dark upon my soul evil dreams came to me in many shapes yet thepurport of each was the samenamely that i woke to find myself quitealone in the world to and fro i walked in a desolate valley stoppingnow and again to call on the name of myra for whom i sought butalways from the cliffs which shut that valley in echo repeatedmyramyra myraand that was allbefore the dawn i rose and dressed myself finely for the marriagethen accompanied by belus and two running footmen i entered mychariot and drove to the temple of hathor leaving the chariot at thegate in charge of the footmen we were admitted by priests who waitedto lead us to the inner shrine here we stood a while till presentlywe heard the sound of singing then from a side chapel appearedpriestesses eight or ten of them accompanied by choristers andmusicians who played upon harps and other instruments in the centreof this throng a veil thrown over her head and carrying flowers inher hand was myra at the sight of whom my heart leaptshe came she stood at my side the highpriest asked certainquestions then at his bidding i took her hand and set upon her fingera piece of golden ringmoney in token that i endowed her with mygoods announcing also that i took her to be my wife as she tooannounced that she took me to be her husband this done the highpriest blessed us in the name of hathor and other gods while apriestess was sent to the top of the temple pylon to call out to theheavens that we were wednow all was finished and metep her old nurse led myra to the door ofthe sanctuary there to await my coming i stayed a while to thank thepriests and priestesses and the musicians also to direct belus todouble the customary fees and make a special offering to the templethese things he did taking the weighed gold from a bag which he hadbrought with him slowly enough as i thought then the treasurer ofthe temple an aged formal fool must needs detain us while hereweighed the gold and wrote an acknowledgement of my gift uponsheepskinat last when all was done we parted from the priests with farewellsand bowings and hurried to join myra at the gateway of the temple wefound her waiting with metep she greeted me with a sweet smile fornow her veil was gone and she wore a long cloak over her bridal robesyet there was that on her face which caused me to ask if aught wereamissnothing husband she said hesitating at the word yet let usdepart for i see officers of pharaohs guard waiting beyond the outergates and the doorkeeper has told metep that they seek youwell what of it i said i have had much business with pharaoh oflate and doubtless he would learn something of me though indeed i didnot know that he had returned to memphisso myra and i entered the chariot belus walking by its side andcrossed the courtyard to the pylon gates which were opened for us onthe further side of them we were stopped by an officer of pharaohsguard a man whom i knew he saluted sayingwell found count ramose i sought you at your home and was told thatyou were gone with your daughter to worship in the temple of hathor atthis early hour here he glanced at myra who had hidden her facein her hood and smiledi was about to answer that myra was not my daughter but my wife whenhe stopped me waving his handyour pardon count but my errand permits of no delay pharaoh hasreturned to memphis and being much pressed for time because ofbusiness that awaits him at sais has gone on at once to attend theceremony of the burial of the apis god at the tomb of the bulls threeleagues away whence he departs this very night for sais meanwhile hemust see you and the learned belus also to hear your reportconcerning the works in your charge at memphis to give you certaininstructions and to consult with you upon other matters i havehorses here upon which you can mount both of youbut i cannot come i said angrily i have business that keeps meherenow that officer from some hidingplace about his person drew a goldring and held it before my eyesyou are learned count ramose he said and can read the oldegyptian writing tell me whose name and title are on this ringi glanced at it it was a signet of amasis the same i think that hewore himself for i had noted it upon his handthat of pharaoh i answeredyes count and how comes it that i who am but an officer of theguard bear pharaohs seal i will tell you it has been given to meto teach you that i speak with pharaohs voice you must come with meand at once likewise the learned belusi stared at the man whom i knew to be no liar and thought a whilethe matter must be great and urgent that caused pharaoh to summon mein this fashion doubtless he needed my counsel and that of belusupon some high business or it might have to do with the accursed apiscalf which had been born amongst my herd that now would take theplace of the old bull god they buried this day in the tomb of bullsor it might be something elsewith a pang of fear i remembered certain words which amasis had spokenwhen he was or feigned to be drunk at my mothers feast threateningto make an end of me because in me ran the true royal blood of egyptwhat if he were decoying me into the desert purposing that thence ishould return no more a while ago the risk would not have moved meover much a man who from year to year and from day to day strove toprepare himself to leave the world and enter some unknown house oflife or if there were none to dwell for ever in the abodes of sleepbut now how could i dare it whose newmade bride stood by me clothedin love and beauty making death terrible i would not go surely icould escape from this man and flee with myra my chariot stood yonderdrawn by horses as swift as any known in egypt we would leap into itand flee away to hidingplaces i knew of and thence pass to foreignlands beyond the seathus seized with panic the shadow perchance of evils to come ithought rapidly but as i suppose something of what passed within mymind wrote itself upon my face at least that officer smiled and saidlook not at your sword count nor at your chariot you may kill mebut my men wait without or you may flee but you will be hunted downknow that my orders are to bring you to pharaoh alive or dead andbelus the physician with younow myra who all this while had been listening intently with a frozenface broke in sayinggo ramose lest a worse thing befall us i will await your return inour homecaptain i said we obey the command of pharaoh bringing this ladywith usmy commands were to escort you and belus to the presence of the kingbut no other he answered coldlythen belus spoke for the first time sayingnone can fight against fate and what are pharaohs orders but thevoice of fate also often we must reach our end by long and crookedpathshere he turned to myra and added be not afraid that end will bereached remember what i saw some nights gone in the water of thebowl and the words which my spirit then set between my lips for ithink that they are in the way of fulfilment look the lily whichonce turned black beneath the spell now lies white upon your breastembalmed in crystal white it shall remain myra white as your bodyand your soul do you understandi understand she answered faintly in a voice that was full oftearsi went to her i kissed her whispered that we should meet againunharmed for god was good and belus could not lie then i bade metepher nurse to lead her to the chariot and bide with her day and nighttill i returned they went and when they were gone i accompanied theofficer like a man in a swoon seeing nothing but the last glance ofmingled love and fear that myra gave me as the chariot vanished behindthe temple pylonwe mounted on horses and surrounded by an escort rode through thegardens of memphis and across the sands beyond to the greatnecropolis where for thousands of years the nobles and gentlefolk ofegypt had been buried in the consecrated land passing through streetsof their holy tombs we came at last to a temple that stood near to themouth of the great caverns wherein are hid away the bones of the apisbulls outside of which temple flew the banner of pharaoh surroundedby a guard of soldiers we were led into this temple where a ceremonywas in progress conducted by the priests of the god ptah it was verylong made up of rites which however gorgeous to me were butmummeries ending in a kind of sacramental feast whereat all of usfrom pharaoh down must touch with our lips a broth compounded fromthe flesh of the dead apis the smell of which brothfor taste it idid notrevolted meat last this rite was over and i thought that now i should be able tohave speech with pharaoh and be gone not so however for immediatelya procession was formed in which a place was assigned to me as onespecially favoured of the gods because the new apis had been foundamong my cattle accompanied by belus i marched in it preceded bypharaoh his great officers and the highpriests of ptah and ofosiris and surrounded by singers with other priests and nobleswe entered the mouth of a mighty cavern and descended into the bowelsof the earth marching through stifling heat down lamplit passageshewn in the solid rock passing many walledup chapels we came atlength to one which was open here stood a huge sarcophagus thatcontained the mummied bones of the dead apis now began moreceremonies which to me seemed to be without end though what they werei cannot say because from where i stood in the passage little couldbe seen of them also the horrible heat of the place overcame me insuch fashion that i could take note of nothingwhen all was finished pharaoh weighed down with royal and priestlyrobes and ornaments marched past me or rather was carried in a chairlooking like a man asleep and we followed him as best we might tillat length we struggled from that hole into the light and once morebreathed the blessed airnow i asked to be led to the royal presence but was told that thiswas impossible because pharaoh was resting later i was told thatpharaoh was eating and later still that he was asleep being overcomewith fatigue and wine then we were taken to a pavilion where foodthat i could scarcely touch was given to us and afterwards nighthaving fallen to a tent where we must sleep here we lay down becausethere was nothing else to do and guards who tramped up and downwithout made escape impossible thus tossing to and fro bewailingmy fortune and unable so much as to close my eyes did i pass whatshould have been my bridal night racked with doubts and fears and inmy heart cursing apis as never god was cursed beforethe sun rose at length but even then we were not allowed to leave thetent why i could not discover at last came a herald who told me thatpharaoh had departed long before dawn almost alone that he mightavoid the heat and dust made by a great company and that he bade meand belus to follow after himthen i understood that for some unknown reason i was a prisonerwe followed because we must but it was not until we reached saisafter long days of journeying that we were allowed to overtakepharaoh there on the following morning he received us in a privateapartment of the palace in which it seemed that he was wont to hidehimself away when wearied with matters of the state or with quarrelsin his householdwe were led to this apartment and at its door i shrank back in horrorfor it was the same in which years before i had seen the queen atyralying dead upon her couch yes although the furnishings weredifferent without doubt it was the same there was the spot where hercloak had lain upon the floor hiding the bloodstain there was thewindowplace out of which with the strength of madness i had cast thatmurderer the priest ninarimy heart stood still my limbs tottered so that i was like to fallwhy had i been brought to this place of evil omen was it a trick ofpharaohs who knew what memories it held for me or was i led by thehand of fate that here where had died the lover of my youth i toomust give up my breath my mind reeled visions appeared before me icould have sworn that i saw atyra in all her loveliness standingyonder waiting to receive me in her outstretched arms then i heardbelus whispering in my earbe a man out of this chamber once you passed from peril to freedomand happiness and so you shall again come pharaoh waits usi found strength and comfort in these words qualities that have everflowed to me from the strong soul of belus my mind cleared i wasmyself again by the windowplace looking out on the peaceful gardensat pharaoh amasis with a table before him upon which were writings ajug of wine with drinking goblets and his sword which he hadunbuckled for as usual he wore the dress of a general for the resthe seemed to be quite alone though doubtless guards and others werewaiting within call in the chamber through which ninari had entered towreak his vengeancepharaoh looked up and saw usenter count and physicianor magicianbelus he cried in hishearty voice enter be seated without ceremony and drink a cup ofwine with me for if i may judge by myself you must be thirsty aftertoiling northwards in the summer sunwe bowed and obeyed seating ourselves upon two stools that had beenplaced for us as i noted at a distance from the table then pharaohfilled three of the goblets with wine and signed to belus to take twoof them while he kept the third and drank a little from it as thoughto show us that the wine was not poisoned yet as i thought thistold us nothing seeing that the venom might have been placed in ourcups which after the grecian fashion were made of goldnow he said let us drink to better times for know that these arebad indeed for egyptso we drank who had no choice i wondering whether presently i shouldfeel my vitals twisting in agony but this did not happen indeed thewine was of the best and heartened meramose went on pharaoh setting down his cup i fear that you willbe angry with me who have dragged you after me upon this long journeywell i did it because i must who wished to speak to you privatelyand to belus also after i had returned to sais and heard what thetidings were from the lands beyond egypt by all the gods they aredark enough cyrus the persian has conquered lydia and threatensbabylon where rules that old fool nabonidus who thinks of nothingbut the repairing of temples and the statues of ancient gods which hedrags from the cities that worship them to set them up in babylonwhere he can see and prate about them still he is powerful for thereis his son belshazzar that fierce man and babylon is yet mighty anda high wall built between cyrus and his persians and egypt thereforeit is necessary to make a friend of nabonidus as he desires to make afriend of us to which end i have made an offering that i think willplease himhe paused and belus eyeing him sharply askedwill pharaoh be so gracious as to tell us what offering he has madelet the matter be said amasis waving his hand in this highbusiness it is scarcely worth mentioning further than to say thatdotards like nabonidus are pleased with trifles now i turn to abigger business that of cyrus who it may be in the end will conquerbabylon and become a mighty monarch whom egypt must fear lest heshould seek to seize her also therefore it is necessary that i shouldlearn the mind of this persian do you not understand that it is mostnecessary ramose he added staring at mei bowed answering that i didi am glad exclaimed amasis for know that it is my purpose to sendyou to the court of cyrus to make inquiry into all these matters andreport to memust i go as your envoy pharaoh or if not in what condition iasked seeking to gain time while i weighed this command in my mindi think not as my envoy ramose for then cyrus would suspect youalso is not ramose too well known as one of the royal blood of egyptopenly to play this part nay under some false name you might travelas a great merchant trafficking between cyprus and egypt as indeedyou have been to make complaint to cyrus of losses that you havesustained through the conquest of cyprus by egypt and to sound hismind as to its seizure by the persians after the conquest of babylonyes and that of egypt also but all this would be for his secret earpublicly you would pretend that you were sent by me pharaoh to opentrade between egypt and persian or rather by my vizier from whom youwould hold letters of commendation which you must use to cover yoursecret plottings against egypt thus cyrus may be led into revealingsecrets which having learned you will return and tell to me do youunderstand ramosei understand i said who am no fool but one acquainted with thelanguages and the trade customs of the east yet pardon me pharaohfor my own private reasons i do not wish to undertake this missionleast of all do i wish to do so not as an ambassador but in the guiseof a spypharaoh rose from his chair and stared at mecount ramose he said you told me just now that you are no foolbut i begin to think that in this you are mistaken who do not seem toknow when you have received an order or what is the penalty ofdefying the command of pharaoh i hear that you have bought abeautiful palace in memphis one which in the old days was inhabitedby princes of the royal blood do you wish to dwell in it ramoseafter a certain mission has been accomplished or would you choose toremain here and sleep at saistill the day of resurrectionnow understanding that i must submit or die i made obeisance andsaidpharaohs will is mine what pharaoh commands that i do but first iask leave to travel to memphis to settle my affairs and to bidfarewell to my motherit is granted said pharaoh yawning as though he were weary of thistalk for the rest my vizier and officers will instruct you in yourmission and make provision remember ramose that if you serve mewell in this matter after you return there will be few greater men inegypt yes you shall sit upon the steps of the thronewe reached the door when a thought struck me i turned and saidand what of belus o pharaohi spoke to both of you answered amasis knowing well that forthese many years you have never been apart that one of you completesthe other also when two go forth upon a mission one may die and theother live to carry on the work whereas if but one goes all isfinished with his passing breath farewell                             chapter xii                                gonetwelve days had gone by when travelling in one of pharaohs shipsbelus and i drew near to memphis which we hoped to reach thatafternoon for seven of those days we had been detained at saisthough we saw pharaoh no more indeed perhaps that we might not doso he quitted the city upon business or pleasure of his own butcommands reached us to await the visits of his vizier and other highofficers and from them to receive instructions with secret lettersfor cyrus the king of the persians also preparations must be madefor a long journey across the desert to the city of susa where it wassaid that cyrus dwelt when he rested from his warsnow although belus and i pressed all these matters forward they couldnot be accomplished quickly almost it seemed to us as thoughpharaohs officers had orders to hasten slowly so that only a littlewas accomplished each day or sometimes nothing at all at lengthhowever when i was driven almost to madness we were allowed todepart for memphis where it was settled that all which was necessaryshould be prepared for our mission for i must tell that during thosedays in sais in truth though not in name we were prisoners confinedto our quarters in the palace and visited only by the servants ofpharaohbut at last we drew near to the great city and within a few hours ihoped to clasp myra my bride in my arms yet i was troubled i knewnot why dark fears took hold of me of i knew not what nor could iwin any comfort from belus who also seemed oppressed with gloom orforebodings the journey which we had been forced to make to sais wasstrange why could not pharaoh have issued his commands to me here atmemphis instead of drawing me after him for so many weary days thathe might speak to me once in his palace at sais and why had he askedme nothing of the work that he had bidden me carry out upon the templeof ptah were those works but a pretext to keep me where he could layhis hand upon mein the end when i could contain myself no longer i put these andother questions to belusramose he said i cannot answer you yet i will tell you what isin my mind i think that pharaoh is afraid of you and for some reasonof his own desires to be rid of you which is why he sends you uponthis distant and dangerous embassythen he might have caused me to be killed here in egypt belusnay that he could not do for you have served with him and he haseaten your bread on these matters amasis may still have theconscience of a soldier and a guest moreover your blood is known andif you were murdered your death would look very evil and would bringtrouble on him for would it not be said that he had made away withyou because you stood too near the throne but on such journeys asthat which lies before us many accidents happen and if under a falsename you died far away from egypt who would trouble also considerthis business you are to go to cyrus and play a double partpretending to be an envoy from egypt loyal to its king and yetworking against egypt and its king because of some private merchantsgrudge which has to do with her conquest of cyprus now when cyrusdiscovers this or it is revealed to him by other messengers may henot grow suspicious and bring you to death or throw you into prisonespecially if he learns that pharaoh would not grieve if you returnedno moreit is so and i mistrust this embassy i answered with a groanaye ramose it is so yet i say to you have no fear for i am sureyou will come safely through these troubles as you have throughothersthat is good news belus but what of myra how can i leave her atmemphis alone and unprotectedyou cannot ramose she must accompany you disguised if need beonce out of egypt there are other lands where we might shelteri remember no more of this talk for just then we drew near to thequay and my burning desire to see myra caused me to forget all elsewe landed and hiring a chariot drove swiftly to the happy house wheresurely she would be awaiting menow we were passing its gates and it seemed to me that there wassomething strange and unfriendly about the aspect of the place therewas the roofed and columned terrace where myra and i had kissed aslovers but it was empty there were the large doors of sycamore woodbut they were shut not open as they had been in the daytime since iowned that house i knocked on them and presently heard them beingunbolted by someone within they opened and there appeared a man afaithful cypriote steward who had served me at salamiswhere is the lady myra i asked bring me to heri cannot lord he answered awkwardly staring at me as though iwere a ghost she has gonegone i gasped whither has she gone speak man or by amen illmake you silent for everi do not know lord on that day when you went out at dawn shereturned early to the house with the woman metep saying that you hadbeen summoned away and that she awaited you towards midday came thelady chloe your mother and with her a number of men who worepharaohs badge also some women very finely dressed the lady yourmother and the men talked with the lady myra apart but what passedbetween them i do not know the end of it was that she left the housewith them much against her will i think for she was weeping andwas driven away in a chariot accompanied by metep we your servantswere angry and disturbed and would have kept her by force had shenot said hurriedly that a command had reached her from you that shemust obey your lady mother in all things and therefore she wentthough she liked the business little and of it could understandnothing so she went lord and that is all except that we heardafterwards that she had departed down nile in great state upon one ofpharaohs ship no not quite all lord for a lad whom i do not knowbrought a letter which he said a woman called metep had given him tobe delivered to you if you returned to the house here it is andfrom his robe he drew out a roll roughly tied up with a piece of palmfibrelike a man in a dream i undid the roll saw that the writing withinwas in greek and short and quickly penned it ran thus to ramose my husband most beloved i am being taken away down nile and as i understand to some  distant country by pharaohs officers your mother swears to me  that this is by your wish and for my own good also that you await  me oversea but i do not believe her i would kill myself were it  not that belus foretold to me that whatever troubles overtook me  all would be well at last fear nothing for know that i will  surely die rather than break my vows to you because in death we  shall meet again follow me ramose the wisdom of belus will  teach you how and find me or my bones i write this on the ship  as we sail metep has found a messenger farewell beloved ramose  there is no time for more farewell                                                         myrai finished reading and gave the writing to belus then in a cold voicethat did not sound like my own i said to the manyou are steward here guard this place well for it may be that ishall have to go upon a long journey you have moneys of mine in yourhands and more will be paid to you by my debtors and tenants as theyfall due use them on my behalf i trust all to you but be sure thatif you fail me it shall go ill with youi will not fail you lord he answered the tears springing to hiseyes for he was a most honest and faithful man but oh leave us notalonethat i must do for a while i answered and wentwhere to said belus as we entered the chariot which still stood atthe doormy mothers house i repliedsoon too soon we were therewould you not wish to see the lady chloe alone asked belus who ithink feared what i might say or dono i answered it seems that the lady chloe cannot be trustedtherefore it is well that a witness should be presentso he came with me unwillingly enough we found my mother alone in herlarge chamber seated in a thronelike chair and very finely dressedindeed she wore upon her beautiful head the little circlet of goldfrom which rose an ornament that might well have been an uraeus thatmark of royalty which she said amasis had given her leave to bear allof which showed me that she was expecting a visit from someone thoughwho it might be i never learned certainly it was not from megreetings dear ramose she said confusedly i did not hope to seeyou ii understood that that you had gone upon a journey onpharaohs businessas she spoke she came forward as though to embrace me but somethingin my face caused her to change her mind for she shrank back and satherself down again in the chair i looked at her for a little whilethinking to myself that her words revealed that she knew the mind ofamasis as to my mission which perhaps she had herself inspiredwhy do you look at me so strangely she falteredwhere is my wife i asked slowlyyour wife have you a wife ramose surely you have not wed withouttelling me your motherwhere is my wife myra i repeated what have you done with heroh you mean your daughter myra though you call her your wife inerror why as i thought you knew she has left egypt to become aqueen you must be very proud ramose that your daughter shouldbecome a queen as of course i amwhose queen i askedthe queen of a very great king perhaps the greatest in the worldafter pharaohnabonidus lord of babylonhow comes it mother that you have stolen away her whom you call mydaughter though you know well that she is not my daughter but mywife to be forced into marriage with this old dotard of babylonanswer me and swiftlyi tell you that i thought you knew son also it was pharaohs willthe great king nabonidus has sent one of his daughters to be wed topharaoh as you will have heard demanding in return a royal princessof egypt to be his wife the old queen of babylon being dead andpharaoh wishes to make a close alliance with nabonidus so thatbabylon and egypt may stand shoulder to shoulder against cyrus thepersian should he threaten either of themnow in a flash all became clear to me for i remembered the words ofamasis at sais as to making a gift to nabonidus also how he had eyedmyra at the feast my mother made to him and asked her if she would notlike to shine in a royal court lastly i remembered how my mother hadslipped away up nile to meet pharaoh upon secret business with a waveof my hand i stopped her talk sayinghearken while i set out this matter more clearly i think than youcan do lady afterwards you can tell me if i have done so well doesit not stand thus amasis wishing to please nabonidus and bindbabylon to egypt desired to send to him a royal princess to be hiswife or woman you may remember that he spoke of it at your tablegrieving that there was no such princess who could be sent thereafteryou and amasis made a plot to rape away myra pretending that she wasmy daughter and that in her therefore ran some of the royal blood ofthe pharaohs although you knew well that she was not my daughteri did not know ramose i thought that youlied to me on thatmatter wishing to hide some sin of your youthwho as you knew well was not my daughter i repeated for often itold you so as you knew that i took her to wife on that same day whenowing to your plottings pharaoh dragged me after him to sais so thatthis womantheft might be carried out in my absencemy mother muttered something and began to wipe her eyes while i wentonas soon as belus and i were trapped after the marriage in the templeof hathor you loosed pharaohs dogs upon this defenceless girl newmade a wife yes you tore her whom you hate away and set her onpharaohs ship alone save for her old nursei deny it she crieddeny it if you will but know that your spies did not watch her closeenough here is the story in her own writing and i held out the openrollthen my mother crouched down upon the seat her elbows on her kneesher head upon her hands and listened hiding her face from meso she has gone i said she my wife whom i have reared fromchildhood she whom i love better than all the world better than mylife better than my soul she has gone to become the plaything of aneastern kingnay to death for that she will never be it is writtenhere and i tapped the roll you have murdered her as you mymother have murdered me for be sure that if i find her dead swiftlyi shall follow after her to where there is justice or sleepspare me ramose my mother cried whatever i did was for the bestfor the glory of this proud girl who will be a queenyes a queenand for your sake whom pharaoh will advance and indeed already hasadvanced aye andfor i will tell the truthbecause i would be ridof her who has stolen your love from me did she not make you leave myhouse that you might live alone with her and has she not built a highwall betwixt us over which we cannot climb so that you my onlychild whom for years i thought dead are now lost to me againif so i answered in your hatred and vanity you have added to thatwall till now it reaches from earth to heaven for the rest what youdid was for your own sake and not for mine what amasis has paid youfor this treason i do not know or wish to learn perchance he hasgiven you high rank such as pertains to the widows of kings who do nothappen to be royal here she started for this arrow had gone homeor he has endowed you with great wealth and many titles let thatmatter be whatever you have gained learn that you have lost a sonwere you not my mother i think that i should kill you as it is ileave you to be eaten up with your own shame i do not curse youbecause no man may curse the flesh that bore him it is unholy nay ido but leave youfarewell my mother upon whose face i hope never to look again whenas pharaohs concubine you caused me to be born you did me wrongthough mayhap that was decreed but when you stole from me all i loveoh what a crime was that perhaps blinded by a greed for pomp andvanities you do not understand yet one day you will i go to seekher of whom you have robbed me and to find her or to die whicheverit may be for you already i am dead in this life or any other weare for ever separatei turned to leave her with these awful words now in my old age i knowhow awful echoing in her ears suddenly she seemed to awake from herlethargy rising from her seat she sprang upon me she cast her armsabout me sinking upon her knees she dragged me down to her shekissed my garments she babbled words of remorse and woe she calledme her babe her darling i thrust her from me and went at the door ilooked round to see her lying senseless upon the floor i wonder didever mother and son bid farewell in such a fashion and for such acause or have ever a womans jealousy and love of empty pomp done amore evil work thus we parted little guessing where we should meetagainthat night in a place where we lodged for to my own house i would notreturn belus and i debated long and earnestly as to what we shoulddo already he had been at work and learned through secret channelsthat were always open to him who had many bound to him by ties i didnot understand that myra had gone down nile and with metep had leftegypt in charge of that same splendid embassy of babylonian lords andladies who had brought the daughter or granddaughter of nabonidus tobe a wife to pharaoh it seemed that no egyptians went with her for areason that could be guessed had they done so they might have talkedand given the babylonians cause to doubt whether myra were really aprincess of the blood of pharaoh though she was beautiful wore royalrobes and ornaments and had a regal airyes i said to belus but metep can talk and so can myra herselfwho would pay heed to a servingwoman whose throat can be cut if needbe he asked as for myra doubtless all these plotters think thatpride and desire of royal place will keep her silent also fear lestshould she be discovered she would be put to death or made a shame ofas a lying cheatyet she will speak belusaye without doubt she will speak and prove all she says thereinlies her peril or mayhap the peril of amasis against whom naboniduswill be enraged or the peril of both of themi wrung my hands who saw many pictures in my mind myra doing herselfto death rather than be shamed myra being butchered or tortured orcast to soldiers by a furious eastern despot myra escaping from allbut to fall into the hands of amasis who would certainly kill her inhis rage if only to hide his fraud yes and otherstruly the gods have set a snare for us i saidthat which the gods tie the gods can loose ramose have faith forthere is no other crutch upon which to lean my spirit is silenthaving spoken to me once on that night when the lily that myra woreseemed to rot then grew white again in the water of the bowl itspeaks no more yet then it said that all should end well have faiththerefore in my spirit as i have lest you should go mad come nowlet us make our planstaking such comfort as i could from these high words i gathered up mystrength that i might think with a clear brain for long we talkedseeking light this was the end of it there was but one hope ofsaving myrato follow her whither she had gone that as it chancedwe could do having wealth at our command and holding pharaohscommission though in it i was spoken of not by name but only as thebearer of these lettersunder this it is true we were ordered to proceed to the court ofcyrus wherever it might be but susa his capital could be reached byway of babylon though this was not the shortest road thereforemaking no complaint to amasis as to the fate of myra for who canreproach a king and live and leaving it to heaven to avenge that sinupon him we determined to proceed at once upon our mission or so topretendto be short this we did in a few days all was made ready my wealthwas great and we took with us not only a large sum in gold in additionto that which pharaoh provided for the costs of the mission but alsowritten letters from my agents which would enable us to obtain moneyin the cities of the east for the rest discarding an escort wetravelled unattended in the character of merchants desirous of openingup trade with persia and other eastern lands but having hidden aboutus letters from the vizier of pharaoh to all his agents and officersthroughout the east commanding these to give us help as it might beneeded also the secret despatch for cyrus of which i have spokenoffering him the friendship of egypt lastly we took other names icalling myself ptahmes that by which i had been known in cyprus fornone guessed that the merchant of salamis and the count ramose wereone man while belus once more became azar a buyer of eastern goodsthus armed we started upon our search determined if we lived tofollow myra wheresoever she might have gone the question waswhitherhad she gone we learned that the babylonian embassy to which she hadbeen given over had departed to damascus because it was said thatnabonidus the king was in that city making a study of its antiquitiesand religion having left his son belshazzar to rule in babylon sojoining a company of merchants at pelusium we set out for damascushere i must tell how i noted at this time that belus seemed filledwith a strange joy which in such an evil hour i thought almost unholyhow comes it that you are glad when my heart breaks belus i askedof him as we left pelusiumwould you know he answered then i will tell you it is becausethat call is come of which i spoke to you in past days in babylon ihave an enemy who has wrought me worse wrong than any that you suffernow after many years of waiting god gives him into my hand now atlength i go to be avenged upon him i know not how i know only that igo to be avenged ask me no more ramosei looked at him marvelling and there was that in his eyes whichcounselled me to be silent                             chapter xiii                               babylonbehold us at length in damascus after weeks of weary travellingdelayed by many accidents and of suspense that ate up my soul onlyto find that nabonidus had left this city more than a month before assecretly as we might we inquired whether a royal wife from egypt hadbeen brought to him while he dwelt there and by some were told onething and by some another it seemed certain that an embassy of hisreturned from egypt had waited on him in damascus for so we wereassured by pharaohs agent a subtle halfbred syrian but whetherthey brought with them any lady to become one of his household was notcertain at least on this matter none would speakleast of all theagent who we could see suspected us notwithstanding our letters forthe babylonians and their subject peoples held it a kind of sacrilegeeven to talk of women appointed to the king indeed our inquiriesveiled though they were brought suspicion on us and after we had leftdamascus disasternow having heard that nabonidus had departed for seleucia and that theembassy which came from egypt had either accompanied or followed himto seleucia we determined to go sending a false report to amasis ofour reasons for so doing yet we never reached that place for when wewere five days journey from damascus of a sudden our caravan wasattacked by men who seemed to be arabs in the darkness before thedawn they rushed upon us so that resistance was impossible in theconfusion belus and i were separated i was seized being felled by ablow on the head as i was about to draw my swordbind him i heard a voice cry in the babylonian tongue harm himnot he is the egyptian spy who pretends to be a merchantso bound i was and lay there among my captors thankful that my lifehad been sparedthe light came and showed the arabs if such they were going off withtheir spoil the merchants with whom we had been travelling were alsodeparting in a great hurry with what goods had been left to themlooking about me i could see no dead which caused me to think thatthe attack had been made either for plunder only or for some otherhidden purpose everywhere i searched for belus with my eyes butcould see nothing of him certainly he was not among the fleeingmerchants i was taken to a tent that had been pitched led by two menwho when they reached it threw off their arab robes and revealedthemselves dressed as babylonian soldiers in the tent were officersalso of babylon and a man whom from his attire i took to be a scribeor priest there too was my baggage already being examined thoughnot that of belus here known as azarthe officers bowed to me courteously then the chief of them said inthe accadian tongueyou take much wealth with you traveller and he pointed to the bagsof gold that they had foundi answered haltingly in the same language which i pretended to speakbut ill that i was a merchant journeying to iran to buy goods fromthe persiansyes he replied with a grave smile we know that you go to dealwith the persians then he nodded to the soldiers who began to removemy garmentsit is not needful i said with dignity i admit that i am more thana merchant i am also an ambassador from the pharaoh of egypt to cyrusthe great kingindeed answered the officer if that is so what were you doing indamascus making inquiry concerning offerings from pharaoh tonabonidus king of babylon did pharaoh whose ambassador you say youare order you to travel to susa by way of damascus and seleuciaseeing that babylon is at war with persia it seems a strange roadnow i pretended not to understand whereon the officer said sternlywill you deliver up your letters to cyrus if you have any or willyou choose to be killed as a spy here is the rope from about yourbaggage and outside stands a tree that will serve to hang you onseeing that according to our law it is not allowed to shed the bloodof an envoy such as you say you arenow i thought for a moment if i refused they would either hang me atonce or take me to babylon to be tormented as was the barbarousfashion of these people also they would search my clothes andbelongings piece by piece and find the letters further i did notwish to die who sought myra and lastly i had little scruple inbetraying the secrets of amasis which indeed i could not hide whobegan to believe that amasis was for the second time betraying me sowithout more ado i told them where the writings were since my handsbeing tied i could not produce themthe letter to cyrus written inthe persian language sewn up in my undergarment and the letters toegyptian agents cunningly hidden elsewhere how i will not stay todescribeyou speak our tongue better than you did at first ptahmes theegyptian said the officer as he handed the writings to the priest orscribethis man scanned them swiftly and saidthe letters to the agents of egypt throughout the east are the sameas that which this ptahmes delivered to pharaohs officer in damascuswhich we have seen the letter to cyrus the king seems to be writtenin a kind of secret script that i cannot decipher easily it must goto babylon with the prisoner who perhaps may be willing to read it tous himselfi shook my head sayingi am not able to do so for i have not studied it it was given to meto deliverno more but if you will find my travelling companionazar who is learned in all these secret writings perhaps he can helpyouthis i said hoping to discover what had chanced to belusthe scribe looked at the officer as though in question and inobedience to some sign answeredif you mean the babylonian who was travelling with you knowegyptian that when he was seized and in danger of his life by tokenswhich we could not doubt he revealed himself to be one of high rankamong our people although he has been absent for long from babylon apriest and a magician also whom it was not lawful for us to detaintherefore we let him go lest he should bring the curse of marduk uponus whither he went we do not know but being a magician perhaps hevanished awaynow i understood that these people would tell me nothing of the fateof belus but whether this was because they were afraid of him orbecause he had been murdered i could not guess so i remained silentafter this an inventory of all my goods and especially of the goldwas made by the scribe a copy of it being handed to me then mygarments were returned to me but the gold and the letters were set ina chest which was sealed by the scribe and by three of the officerseach of whom rolled upon the clay an engraved cylinder whereon werecut the images of his godsafterwards my arms were loosed although my feet remained shackled andi was given food when i had eaten a camel was brought upon the backof which were fastened two large baskets of woven willow twigshanging down on either side in one of these baskets were placed allmy goods and in the other i was laid the lid being tied down overmethus i started upon my journey to babylon for thither the officertold me i must be taken to be examined by the king or his servantswho he added grimly would know how to find out my true name andbusiness three days did i pass in that basket being lifted out of itonly at night and to eat food the most wretched days i think that ican remembernot only was i cramped and shaken but my heart was as sore as mylimbs everything had gone wrong myra was snatched away belus hadvanished leaving me alone and as i was sure and grew more so hourby hour amasis had betrayed me oh now i understood he had warnedor ordered his agents to warn the babylonians of my mission to cyrusand given me letters to carry which would be certain to make themwrath with me and perhaps cause them to put me to death as a spymoreover i could not complain seeing that instead of travellingstraight to susa i had followed myra into babylonian territory asdoubtless he guessed that i should do and there was snared thereforei must suffer whatever befell me in silence and had no refuge save totrust in god for always i have believed that there is a god whowatches over those who put faith in him though he be not named ammonor mardukon the fourth day of our journey when i was almost overcome by theheat in my basket and misery of body and of mind the officers took meout of it and set me upon a horse at first i thought they did thisfrom friendliness or perhaps because they feared lest i should dieupon their hands but having grown suspicious of all men afterwardsi came to believe that they had another motive they hoped i thoughtthat i should try to run away when they would be free to kill me forwhich reason two spearmen and two mounted archers always rode on eachside of me whether or not this was their purpose i cannot tell butcertainly i had no mind to fly who knew not where to go moreover iwished to reach babylon whither as i gathered from the talk of theofficers nabonidus the king had repaired knowing that if so myrawould be there alsoat last one day shortly after dawn the walls of the mighty city arosebefore us out of the mists of the morning that the sun drew from itsencircling river wonderful was the sight most wonderful as the lightfell upon those towering walls and upon the huge stepped mound wherestood the temples of the gods and upon the thousands of houses thatstretched around never had i seen such a city compared to it memphisand thebes were but as little towns and at any other time the visionof it would have rejoiced me who have always loved such prospects butnow when the officers asked me what i thought of babylon i could onlyanswer that the trapped bird cares nothing for the glories of itscage words at which they laughedall that day save for a long halt during the hours of noon wetravelled slowly towards babylon through cultivated gardens wherethousands were at work after these were passed we crossed the greatriver in a flatbottomed boat which held both us and our horses forhere the baggage camels were left behind and with them the brute uponwhich i had travelled in my basket for so many weary hours then werode through more gardens till we came to a mighty gateway in theenormous outer walls that towered over us like a precipice of bricksbeyond these was another wall with another gateway and here we weredelayed for some time till gorgeously apparelled blackbearded menwhom i supposed to be servants of the king arrived to escort usthese men who stared at me curiously led us through league afterleague of streets crowded with people who hurried to and fro takingheed of nothing save the business on which they were bent so it wenton till darkness fell through which we were guided by men withtorches at length in the gloom i saw before me some vast buildingupon whose walls and roof burnt cressets of fire and guessed that itmust be a temple or a palace in fact it was the latter for presentlywe reached its door or one of its doors where i and all my goodswere handed over to a guard and to certain men whom i took to bepalace eunuchs by these i was led down many passages to a chambernot over large but well furnished with a bed and all that wasnecessary here food and wine were brought to me by one who locked thedoor behind him when he went away leaving me alone save for the guardwhom i heard pacing the corridor withoutthat night passed but ill for me who after the air of the desert feltstifled in this hot chamber which was in fact a prison as i judged bythe small windowplace barred with rods of copper and cut high in thewall where it could not be reached also i was very troubled atlength i had come to babylon but oh what had fate in store for me atbabylonin the morning more food was brought to me and clean garments some ofmy own taken from my baggage together with a long white robe of softmaterial beautifully woven when i asked the jailer what it was hereplied curtly that all who appeared in the presence of the king mustwear this robe but would say no more so now i knew that i was to gobefore the king which perhaps meant that after i had been questionedi should be executed as a spy well if so soon my sorrows would bedonea little later the door opened again and with a guard there appeared abarber who set to work upon my hair which had grown long during thejourney curling and scenting it next he cut my beard square in thebabylonian fashion one that i much disliked who always wore itpointed then he washed me carefully and trimmed my nails till atlast i asked if i were going to a feast the answer was no but thatall who appeared before the king must be purified also that this wasa day of festival at the court when they must be made even purer thanusualscarcely had he finished rubbing me with his scented unguents till ismelt like some perfumed court darling when a fat eunuch richlyapparelled appeared at the head of an escort and having examined meas though i were a calf being led to sacrifice commented thatalthough an egyptian i was a finelooking man fit to take a ladysfancy and bade me follow him this i did wondering whether some courtwoman of high degree had chanced to cast her eyes on me and groaningat the thought it was not so however for after passing through manypassages and across courtyards we came to a curious doorway with stonegods or demons standing on either side and going up some stepsentered an enormous pillared hall all the lower part of this hall wasempty but at its far end a man sat upon a throne while about himthough at a distance were gathered many court officers also greatprinces and nobles and behind him was a guard of soldiersthe eunuch and those with him even while they were still a long wayoff bent down till they looked like monkeys climbing along a boughand thinking it wise i did the same thus we advanced up the greathall till we came to that part where the court was gathered now ifound opportunity to examine the king who sat upon the throne for hehad taken no heed of our approach but was engaged in studying a stonestatue set upon a table near the foot of the throne and in talkingabout it eagerly to a thin tall noblefeatured and quickeyed oldman clad in a black robe whom i took to be a doctor or priest thoughby blood neither babylonian nor greek nor egyptianas for the king himself he was a little withered man of aboutseventy years of age with sharp beadlike eyes that reminded me ofthose of a mouse and a wrinkled but shrewd and kindly face he wasclad in royal robes and ornaments which i noted became him very illand seemed to trouble him for the headdress with the crown on it wastwisted all awry and his golden jewelencrusted cloak had slippedfrom his shoulders also the false ceremonial beard he wore hadbecome detached from his chin and hung loose round his neckbehold the king of kings and be abased whispered the eunuch in myears in a voice in which i thought i detected mockeryi behold him i whispered back and went on bowingi tell you holy hebrew said nabonidus shrilly that you may be avery good prophet but you understand nothing about godstrue o king answered the blackrobed man in a deep and solemnvoice i understand one god only about these idols and he lookedcontemptuously at the stone image on the table i know nothing andcare less now i would speak to your majesty of a pressing andimportantthat is just where you are mistaken prophet belteshazzar or danielfor that is your real name is it not interrupted the kingpetulantly these idols as you call them are extremely powerfulwhy i dug up that one there under the foundations of an ancienttemple that i am repairing and have brought it to babylon to add tomy collection of the gods of my empirewell what has happened the whole province whence it came is almostin revolt indeed it threatens to make common cause with cyrus thepersian my enemy or rather the enemy of babylon for personally weare on quite friendly terms and write to each other about antiquitiesall this if you please because i have brought away the image of agod that none of their forefathers can have seen for generationssince the tablets buried with it written in old accadian show thatit was set beneath the angle of the temple probably in a time ofdanger at least a thousand years ago yes although they do not knowthe name of the god and have only a tradition that it was buried therein the day of some forgotten king or other they are all up in armsbecause i have removed it yet you speak contemptuously of what youcall idols and want to begin to talk of some other matter i forgetwhat it would be more to the point prophet if your familiar spiritwould tell us the name of this one which i burn to discoverthe prophet called belteshazzar or daniel glanced at the stone imageand shrugged his shoulderscan no one tell me its name went on nabonidus what is the use ofa crowd of magicians who know nothing if it is revealed to anyonehere upon my royal word he shall not lack a rewardnow i who had been studying the statue was moved to speakmay the king live for ever i said if it pleases the king to hearme i say that this holy image is one of ptah a great god of egyptor perhaps of bes a syrian god whose worship in egypt began in thetime of amenophis iii nearly a thousand years ago or even earlierwithout examination i cannot say whether it be ptah or bes but i knowthat both of these gods have been sent from egypt at one time oranother to work miracles of healing at the request of the kings andprinces of the easthere at last we have one with wisdom cried nabonidus clapping hishands but who is this man a handsome one enough as i note with theeyes and hair of a greekthe scribe advanced bent the knee and whispered in the kings earoh said nabonidus i remember that egyptian spy about whom wewere warned in a letter from and he checked himself let methink he purports and represents himself to be an envoy from ourbrother the pharaoh of egypt to cyrus the persian our enemy at leasta commission was found on him and has been deciphered which says sothough the name of the bearer is not mentioned but probably it isforged indeed it must be forged in face of what we learn about therecord of the man from egypt also if he had really been travellingto susa or wherever that dangerous cyrus may be living at the momenthe would not have been found in damascus making secret inquiriesabout me journeying not as an ambassador should with an escort butdisguised as a merchant lastly we were told that he is one of thegreatest liars in egypt a man who cannot be believed upon his oathand half a greek as indeed he lookshere the king brought his long soliloquy to an end and calling to arobed man whom from his ornamented headdress and splendid broideriesi took to be a councillor or vizier he saidwhat was it you told me ought to be done with this captivespies are best dead o king replied the vizier coldlytrue quite true he ought to be sent to spy in the land of the godswhere doubtless there is a great deal to find out yet it seems a pityto kill so goodly a fellow who is also no fool especially as thanksto the warning he was caught with his forged letters before he gotaway to cyrus to report what he had learned in our empire andtherefore has not done us any harm no vizier i cannot be troubledto listen again to those wearisome documents and reports especiallyas we have heard all about this evildoer from egypt is the princebelshazzar here oh yes i see he is come hither son and give usyour opinion you are the real ruler of babylon are you not whichgives me leisure to attend to more interesting and important mattersand he glanced at the stone image on the table therefore you shouldbear your share of the burden such as deciding about executions abusiness that i hateas he spoke from the centre of a group of nobles who stood to theright of the throne with whom he had been conversing carelessly whilenabonidus talked with the prophet about the image appeared a splendidfigure who wore upon his head something like a crown he was middleaged for the hair upon his temples was turning grey tall and broadblack bearded and eyed hooknosed and cruelfaced with the thickmoist lips of one who is led by his appetites he came forward bowedslightly to the king and looked me up and down then full in the faceour eyes met and at once i felt that this man was my enemy one whohated me at first sight as i hated him and was destined to work meevil yet i paid him back glance for glance till at length he turnedhis head understanding as i was sure that i was no common fellowwhom he could despise and that if i had spied it was for no meanreasonas you ask me o king he said in a thick loud voice i agree withthe vizier this knave should be killed at once or rather torturedto death for doubtless out of his agonies may come some truth thatwill be of service and value to us also his real name which for someunknown reason has not been revealed to us had i chanced to fill thejudgment seat today as it was settled that i should if anothermatter had not brought you here o king such at least would have beenmy sentencemy blood froze at these words yet in some strange calm fashion asthough i were considering anothers case and not my own i was able totake note of all thus i saw the face of the prophet who was calledbelteshazzar flush and his lips move as though he were uttering aprayer i saw nabonidus shake his head uneasily like one who hearscounsel that is not to his taste i saw the vizier smile in a coldfashion and the officer of the guard look towards the soldiers asthough he were about to order them to hale me away while the othersglanced at me curiously to learn how i bore this hammerblow of fateanother instant and the king was speakingyou have heard egyptian he said the prince yonder who is reallythe judge of such matters has spoken and it only remains for me toconfirm his doom as being in the judgment seat i must do according tothe law before it can be carried out for here in babylon even theking is the humble servant of the law have you anything to urge uponyour own behalfa great deal o king i answered more perhaps than you would havepatience to hear it is true that i am an envoy to cyrus sent to himupon business by the pharaoh of egypt against my will because amasiswishes to make friends with all the rulers of the east but that i ama spy is not truehere nabonidus held up his hand to silence mewhy waste your words he said when you were found spying on behalfof cyrus and bearing forged letters which do not give your namewhen too we have been assured from egypt that you are the greatestof all liars if you have nothing more to say i fear that i must bringthis business to an end as the vizier reminds me that another of moreimportance waits which also has to do with egypt so be brief i prayyounow a fury entered into me that struck me dumb so that i could onlyanswer mockinglythen o king i grieve that i shall find no opportunity to examineyonder image and i pointed to the statue on the table and to tellyour majesty whether it be that of ptah or bestrue said nabonidus and you understand about gods do you notyes o king i who am a philosopher and a student understand aboutthe gods of egypt and their attributes also about those of the eastand those of persia and of the farther lands beyond as i could showyou were the time given meis it so peace vizier i know the lady waits let her wait am i ofan age or taste to be in haste to marry again hearken i will not behurried you need not frown at me belshazzar for i do not heed youor anyone i am still king of babylon the first servant of heavenwith power of life and death i refuse to condemn the man calledwhatis he called oh ptahmes in this fashion take him aside to yondergallery and keep him there treating him well as a learned strangerwhen the other business is finished i will speak with him again obeylest some of you be shortened by a head i bid you obey instantlyand he struck the arm of the throne with his sceptrenow his servants who knew well how these sudden furies of the weak butpassionate old king could end if he were thwarted namely in the lossof their own lives or offices sprang forward in a great hurry and ledme away we went through swinging doors and along a passage until wecame to a stair hollowed in the thickness of the brick wall of thepalace up this stair we climbed and at length reached a gallery setvery high near to the lofty roof indeed and enclosed with a kind ofwood lattice such as is common in egypt through which one could seewithout being seenthe eunuch who accompanied me with the guard wishing to please melest by some sudden turn of the wheel of fortune of a sort that oftenhappens at the courts of these eastern kings i who a moment ago wasabout to be condemned to a lingering death should become powerful andable to repay injuries hastened to inform me that this was the placewhence the ladies of the royal house were sometimes allowed to lookdown on ceremonies of state he added that whether by accident orskill he did not know it was so contrived that those who sat in itcould hear all that was said below whereas even if they were toshout their voices would never reach those gathered in the halli thanked him and seated myself upon a carved stool which he broughtto me in such fashion that through peepholes i could see everythingthat passed as it chanced there was much worthy of note the doors ofthe great hall had been thrown open and through them flowed a gailydressed multitude of guests beyond these at the end of the hall inthat place where i had been judged immediately beneath my gallerymany courtiers and officers were assembling before the throne at thehead of whom i noted the prince belshazzar he who had counselled thati should be tormented to deathat first this throne was empty for nabonidus had left it for a whilewhen he reappeared i saw the reason for now he was gorgeouslyapparelled and his headdress and beard which had been disarrayedwere straightened so that in his jewelled robes he wore the aspect ofa great king                             chapter xiv                      the prophet and the princefor a while from this high place i watched the scene wondering idlywhat it might portend as a man does who knows not whether he hasanother hour to live indeed it was not till afterwards that thechatter of nabonidus as to marrying again came back to my mind whichat the time was full of all that i had heard as to the hideous methodsby which eastern kings did their enemies or those who were condemnedas malefactors to death with fire and water and hooked instrumentsthat slowly tore the vitals out of them in a fashion that was notknown in egypt also it was full of rage against amasis who as now isaw clearly although he did not guess that it would bring me tobabylon had sent me on this mission that it might be my last for hadhe not betrayed me to these babylonians naming me a spy to make sureas he thought of the death of one of whom for his own reasons hewould be rid by the hands of others thus leaving his own unstainedbut when there arose a cry of the bride comes the royal ladycomes every word of that talk as to taking another bride came backto me and i felt my heart stand stillwhat if this bride this royal lady should chance to be my own wifemyra what if i should be forced to witness the giving of her to thatcrowned dotard whose foolishness had just saved me from death if onlyfor an houri turned to the eunuch and asked him what was the meaning of thisceremony but either he did not understand my question or thought itunlawful to answer at least he remained silentnow through the open doors came a number of fair women singing anddancing then followed musicians playing upon flutes and otherinstruments and after them heralds who bore gifts upon cushions nextappeared a litter surrounded by a guard of soldiers the litter wasset down the guard withdrew to right and left waiting ladies of theroyal household advanced and drawing the curtains of the litterhelped her who was within it to descend she came forward and followedby a woman of short stature dressed in a plain robe walked to an openspace in front of the litter now i could see her well for the lightfrom a high window fell upon herit was myra herself and her attendant was the old nurse metep yesthus again i saw myra from whom i had parted months before outside thetemple of hathor at memphisshe was royally arrayed and wore as i noted all the wonderful jewelsthat were her heritage also the crystal pendant containing the littlepressed lily that i had given her after belus had seen visions in thebowl at the happy house in memphis upon her breast too was theemerald cylinder covered with strange writing which was among the gemsin the bag her mother had thrust upon me in the tent on thebattlefield for all these and others had been sent with her frommemphis further upon her brow holding her hair in place was alittle golden circlet from the centre of which sprang the royal uraeusof egypt even at this distance i could catch the flashing of itsjewelled eyes thus adorned she glided up the great hall staringabout her like one bewildered who knew not where she was or what shedid a vision of such wondrous beauty that a murmur of amazement arosefrom the lips of the assembled companyshe reached the space before the throne where but a few minutes beforei had stood a captive condemned to death and halted there in thepause that followed i could see the courtiers and the nobles bendforward to study her loveliness and especially the bold eyes of theprince belshazzar fixed upon her face next stiffly enough the oldking nabonidus descended from the throne and coming to her parted thethin transparent veil that covered her from head to foot and kissedher on the brow thereon all criedthe great king accepts the royal lady of egypt may the king live forever may the royal lady his wife live for everthe echoes of this formal shout of welcome which announced thatnabonidus had taken another wife in the presence of his people diedaway and suddenly myra seemed to awake and began to speak she spokelow yet as the eunuch had told me that hall was so built that everysyllable reached me in the highset secret gallerytouch me not o great king she said in a voice of music and usingthe babylonian tongue which she knew well for i am not worthywhat do you mean lady asked nabonidus astonished it seems to methat both in beauty and by rank you are worthy of any king who eversat upon the throne of babyloni have no rank o king she answered who was not born of the royalhouse of egypt nay i am but a foundling taken from my dying mothersbreast upon the field of battle in the time of merodach amasis thepharaoh of egypt for his own purposes has deceived you o king hestole me away from my home because i am wellfavoured and palmed meoff upon your envoys as a princess of the line of pharaoh thiscoronet i wear is not mine o king and with a sudden motion she torethe uraeus circlet from her brow and flung it away so that herabundant hair was loosed and fell down about herfrom all who heard these bold words came mutterings and gasps ofastonishment for that such an affront should be put upon the majestyof the king of babylon seemed to them impossiblenabonidus lifted his hand and they were silent then he saidif what you say is true lady the pharaoh of egypt has done me agreat wrong and one which many would seek to wash away in blood butis it true and even if it be true well i have accepted you and yourmien is fair and royal if your blood be not though indeed he addedas if to himself to me who am so old fair women royal or other noware naughthe thought for a moment then continued this is a tangled coil butif you can prove what you allege it still seems best and would do youleast dishonour that you should enter the palace as one of the ladiesof my householdit cannot be o king said myra in a strained voice and i saw thepearls upon her breast quiver as she spokecannot be why cannot it be he asked sternly adding great kingsdo not listen to such wordsbecause o king i am already wed and therefore unmeet for the royalhousehold spare me o king and she sank to her knees stretchingout her arms in supplicationalready wed he exclaimed shrinking back from her while some ofthose present in tones of horror echoed the words already wedfor as i learned afterwards for ages no such sacrilege had been knownas that one who was married should be given to the great king as awife or as a member of his householdlet the woman be taken away said a voice i think it was that ofthe vizier who had interpreted the kings motion as an order of deathnay exclaimed nabonidus i did not speak if her story be truenamely that she was torn from her home and sent hither to me disguisedas a royal princess of egypt in return for my daughter given topharaoh then the blame is pharaohs and not hers and with pharaoh wemust settle our account but i repeatis it true though that a womanshould lie upon such a matter thus throwing away the place of queenof babylon seems strange unless love drives her lady have you anyevidence to your talemyra still upon her knees looked over her shoulder and said in theegyptian tonguecome hither nurse and tell the king who i am and how i came hereso metep stood forward staring about her in a bewildered fashion forshe had understood no word of all this talk in the babylonian tonguesoon it was seen that she could only speak through an interpreterafter some search an officer was found who knew egyptian though nottoo well for he spoke it haltingly and with a foreign accent atlength he asked her whether it was true that her mistress was marriedmetep answered yes she is married unless the priests of hathor areall liars and then began a rambling story of how myra had been takenaway from the happy house by the servants of pharaoh with whom camethe great lady chloe and how she had clung to the doorway pillarstill they dragged her arms apart a tale that caused me to grind myteeth with rage still it was one of which the king soon weariedespecially as the officer interpreted but illthis old woman is a babbling fool he said let her be silent isthere no other here who can speak of this matter if not the lady hadbest be removed to the womens court and set among those to whom theking has bidden farewell until our pleasure concerning her is knownthen suddenly there stepped forward a man clad in the robe of ababylonian astrologer for on it and on his pointed cap were paintedstars and other strange emblems by the gods it was belus yes belushimself and no other and oh my heart leapt at the sight of himwho is this asked nabonidusmay it please the king answered belus i am one whom the king onceknew well before he was called to the throne of babylon yes isprang from one who sat upon that throne before him i was scribe andastrologer in the royal household a priest also of marduk and ofishtar the queen of heaven in those days i who am now known asbelus or as azar had another name which the king may remember ifnot i will whisper it in his ear and stepping forward he bent hishead and said something that caused nabonidus to start then retiringhe went onthe king will recall my story i was married but had not lost my wifewho left me with a daughter that maiden was exceedingly fair she wasstolen from me it matters not by whomhere i thought that heglanced at belshazzar who i saw was listening intently the maid wasone of spirit and because she fought against fate she was murderedher body was thrown into the river and found with a letter in her robethat told all the tale if the king would see that letter i have ithere i sought redress but found none therefore i left babylon andwent to dwell at the court of the pharaoh of egypt leaving behind memy curse on those by whom i have been wrongedhere again i thought that he glanced towards belshazzarnever have i returned to babylon although i still have friends hereto whom i write from time to time these can testify of me as can themasters of magic and the readers of the stars with whom i am ever incommunion yet fate has brought me back to babylon as soon or late iknew well that it would do now is the king satisfied that i am a trueman to prove which i have told him all this storyi am satisfied and i accept the story which to my sorrow i haveheard before o friend of my youth answered nabonidusthen if the king will be pleased to listen i will witness concerningthis lady whom i have known from childhood as she has said she wastaken from the arms of her dying mother when an infant after the greatbattle between the egyptians and the babylonians in which the princemerodach commanded the forces of babylon for i saw her brought to histent by the egyptian captain who found her and with her those jewelswhich she wears today that captain who was my friend and with whom idwelt nurtured her to womanhood all supposing that she was hisdaughter till at length but a little while ago he took her to wifeimmediately afterwards she was stolen away by the pharaoh of egyptand because of her great beauty and royal bearing was sent in thecharacter of a princess of egypt to be a wife to your majestya trick for which pharaoh shall pay dear especially as i havetouched her with my lips and therefore accepted her as my wifeexplained nabonidus yes and my wife she must remain until i diefor is it not an ancient law that what the king of babylon does incouncil before the people can never be undonenow when i heard these words in my watchingplace hope left me as ithink it did myra for i saw her tremble and rest her hand on theshoulder of metep as though she were about to fall still i set myteeth and listened onwhat is the name of the man to whom this lady is wed and what hisstation o friend of my youth now known as belus and travelling underthat of azar asked the kinghis name is ramose o king one who in my company follows afterlearning and holds high office in memphis in egypt by birth he is ason of apries late pharaoh of egypt having a grecian lady calledchloe for his mothernow the vizier whispered something in the ear of the king who noddedand saidtherefore one of whom the present pharaoh the slayer of aprieswould wish to be rid oh now i see all the plan the husband whosheltered the child as his daughter and afterwards made her his wifeis the bastard of a pharaoh of the true descent and thus has royalblood in his veins hence she the supposed daughter is called aroyal princess and as such declared to be a fit wife for the majestyof babylon truly a plot well worthy of the baseborn venturer whosits upon the throne of egypthe paused his old hands shaking with wrath then turned to myra andaskedmuch wronged lady what am i to do with youo king i pray you give me back to my husband whom i love and wholoves mewhere is your husbando king i do not know when i left egypt in charge of your officers iheard that pharaoh detained him at his court perchance belus thereknows for never have they been separated for many yearsif so belus may be wise to keep silent lest pharaoh should learnhis answer said the king warningly listen lady according to ourlaw you are now my wife the past matters not i have touched you withmy lips and you are the wife of the king of babylon is that not thelaw vizierit is o king he replied bowing henceforward if any man venturesto look upon this woman yea even though he were once her husband hemust die and if she shares his guilt she must die with himyou hear lady said the kingi hear she whisperedyet he went on be sure that you have naught to fear from me whodo not wish to anger the gods by such a sin and therefore lest youshould be troubled on this matter you shall not enter into myhousehold nor can you be sent back to egypt for many reasons andabove all for your own sake for then pharaoh amasis would be avengedupon you who have betrayed his villainy where then must you goto the tomb i think she answered in a faint voice there aloneare rest and safetynay answered the old king looking on her with kind eyes you aretoo fair and overyoung to die who knows what the gods may have instore for you yet what am i do to with younow i saw that blackrobed thinfaced dreamyeyed old man who wascalled daniel or belteshazzar and a prophet step forward out of thecrowd of courtiers he came to myra and studied her face next hedropped his eyes and stared fixedly at the emerald amulet which hungbeneath the pearls and other ornaments upon her bosom then he turnedto the king and saidmay the king live for ever it is revealed to me o king that thislady is by blood one of a captive people who dwell in this kingdomthat of the hebrews to which i too belong never before have i beheldher still i say it is revealed to me o king it has pleased you andsome who sat upon your throne before you to show me favour and to makeme a ruler in your landwe know your story o prophet belteshazzar answered nabonidus in avoice that was touched with awe and that you are favoured andprotected by your god with whom you commune day and night it isneedless to repeat it before those who have seen your miracles if youhave any petition to make concerning this woman speak on rememberingthat having been accepted by me under our law which may not bechanged she can be given to no other man who livesi have a petition to make o king answered the prophet the kingknows what i am and my manner of life let this lady and her servantbe given into my charge till the will of god concerning her is knownmeanwhile i swear that during the kings lifetime she shall be visitedor spoken to by no other man and thus the law of babylon as to thosewho have been accepted by the king shall not be broken let officersbe set about my house to watch the fulfilment of my oathnabonidus thought a while then he said wearilyi tire of this business scribes write down my decree i commandthat the woman named myra whom i accepted believing her to be a royalprincess of egypt given to me in exchange for that royal lady ofbabylon whom i have sent as a wife to pharaoh but who it seems isalready wed to another man and therefore unfit to enter my householdshall be placed in the charge of belteshazzar my servant a prophetof the people of judah to hold in ward until my pleasure concerningher is known i command that a guard be set by day and night about thedwelling of the prophet belteshazzar to make sure that this woman hasno converse with any other man if she is found in company or speechwith any man save the prophet let her and that man be slain nowtouch my sceptre both of you o prophet and woman myra in tokenthat you acknowledge my decreeso saying he stretched out a little golden rod that all this while hehad held in his hand first to one of them and then to the otherthereby assuring them of safety and making his word unchangeablethey touched the sceptre the sternfaced blackrobed prophet bowedto the king and beckoned to myra to follow him a guard formed roundthem and they departed from the hall of audience by a side entrancemyra who seemed crushed with grief leaning on the shoulder of metepfor she tottered as she walked her path led her past the spot wherethe prince belshazzar governor and viceking of babylon stoodsurrounded by his courtiers he bent forward and stared at her in afashion of which none could mistake the meaning then uttered somejest to the lords that caused them to laugh and the prophet to turnhis head and look at him as though in rebuke next this belshazzaradvanced to the throne and said something to the king in a low voicewhich i could not catch whatever it may have been it angerednabonidus for he flushed and replied wrathfullywhat i have said i have said who am still king in babylon and itshall go ill with any who defy me yes even with you princein the silence that followed these threatening words he waved hissceptre thereby declaring the court at an end left the throne anddeparted attended by his officersbelshazzar watched him go then he shrugged and said in a loud andangry voice to his attendantseven kings do not live for ever and their decrees die with them sooni will find yonder lovely one a gayer home than the cell of that blackhebrew wizard a speech at which some laughed and others lookedafraid for it was treasonablethe great hall emptied the glittering crowd pouring through thedoorways like a stream of gold and jewels soon they were all gonefor a while i sat on in the secret gallery so overwhelmed with what ihad endured that i could scarcely think at last a messenger came whowhispered to the watching eunuch thereon he touched me on theshoulder and led me away surrounded by the guard i went wonderingwhether i was being taken to my death but it was not so forpresently once more i found myself in my prison where they left mealone                              chapter xv                         ramose finds friendsthey brought me food but i could not touch it though of their strongwine i drank a goblet or two which gave me back what i seemed to havelost the power to thinkstrange and dreadful was my case i had found myra but to lose heragain for ever although for the present she had escaped violence andwas left alive in what seemed to be safe hands those of the hebrewprophet about whom such marvellous tales were told and who was fearedof alli who was a student of the customs of foreign nations well knew thoseof assyria and babylon and indeed of all the monarchs of the eastnamely that women were their chattels and that any who once had passedtheir doors and entered their presence were sealed to them for everand under pain of death might henceforward be seen only by other womenand by eunuchs the man who spoke to them was doomed even though hewere a brother they were dead to the world such was the lot of myrawhich perhaps she might have escaped had she but spoken earlierbefore moved by her beauty the old king accepted her yet how couldshe speak who did not know or understandstay belus whom i thought lost had appeared again clothed with powerand as a friend of the king who it seemed had been a companion of hisyouth in belus there was hope yet what could belus do he might sowork that my life would be spared for which if myra were lost to mei should not thank himno more and that beetlebrowed fierceeyedbelshazzar that prince of evil fame the real king in babylon whobut for some chance if there be any chances in the world would havesat that day upon the seat of judgmentwhat of him he had cast eyesof longing upon myra and what he desired soon or late he would surelytake as he had declared but now unless indeed she escaped him by thegate of death oh my strait was sore and i had naught on which tolean save trust in god if there were any god who paid heed to themiseries of us poor mortals and stretched over them the shield ofjusticeyet life still remained to us and while we lived all might beretrieved for the last throw had not been cast in my agony i prayednot knowing to whom or to what to prayo power that made the world i cried in my heart o strengthunseen unknowable that drew us out of darkness and set us on thisgaudy changeful stage whence presently we must fall into deathsdeeper darkness o vast intelligence that deviseth all o beginningand end that is no end o point of time and circle of eternity hearme the mote of dust blown by thy breath help me and her thou gavestme who has been made the sport of vanity and statecraft save her fromshame and of thy mercy give us who love each other our little hour oflight before we are borne back into blackness rob us not of thecommon gift that is poured upon beast and bird and flowerthe joythey know beneath the glory of the sun or if this may not be let uspass hence swiftly and hand in hand go to seek that which lies beyondthe sunin some such words i prayed and as the last of them passed my lipsthe door opened and a messenger appearedrise up he said the great king commands your presencea guard following me i went with him to the private apartments of thepalace we passed through many that were gorgeous to a large plainchamber well lit from the roof here upon a chair set against atable sat a man whom at first i did not know a little withered oldman dressed in such a robe as workmen wear looking at him again iperceived that it was none other than nabonidus the king stripped ofall his finery and engaged in eating a meal the food was simple onthe bare table were a jug of wine and a goblet or two all of them asi knew who collect such things dating from ancient days then therewas bread and with it a bird cut up upon a platter cheese made ofgoats milk and a handful of onions such was the fare of this monarchof the earthi prostrated myself but he called to me to rise sayingwe are not at court here you are the egyptian who understands aboutgods are you not well have you eaten after all that wearisomeceremonyi replied that i had not whereon he addedthen come sit down and take some of this duck if you can get yourteeth through it which i cant and if not the bread and the cheeseare good and soft and the country wine not bad dont stare at meyou fool of a eunuch of course i know he can kill me if he likes buthe wont for learned men and i take it he is one of them who studyand seek out the secrets of the past never kill each otherexceptwith their tongues also if he did i am not certain that i should besorry there is so much that i cannot learn in this world that irather look forward to another where if there are thrones may itplease the gods i shall not fill one of them out you go eunuch andtake that guard with you i hate to see them watching me and theshining of their swords and to listen to the clatter of their armourswords to stab and armour to turn them and war war war these arethe world into which an evil fate has cast me and i weary of themall dont stand there stammering out you go if he kills me you cankill him afterwards and we will continue our discussion elsewherebut i tell you he wontso the eunuch and the guard went unwillingly enough staring first atnabonidus and then at menow come and sit down said the king there isnt another stool orat least they all have things on them but that old pottery coffinwill do as well i often use it myselfo king i am unworthy i beganby marduk or by ishtar or by ammon of egypt whichever you preferthat is for me to judge not for you dont waste time man look atall the relics i want to talk to you about and he pointed to longtables on which stood a number of stone gods among them those that ihad seen in the hall of audience and trays full of inscriptions gravedupon clay or marble tablets and cylindersso i sat myself upon the old pottery coffin which i observed stillhad bones inside it and began to eat for now i know not why myappetite had returned to me perhaps hope was working in my hearti did you a favour just now egyptian said the king with achuckle when i told them to fetch you they answered that theyfeared it was too late as my son belshazzar had issued an order foryour execution in my name perhaps because he thought i meant you todie after all or because he wished to be rid of you i dont knowwhich however he wont do that again for i commanded that hispeople whom he was sending on the business should be seized andbeaten on the feet until they can only crawl away upon their hands andknees really he added reflectively it is belshazzar who shouldsuffer not his servants only you see he is almost as much a king asi am thats the way of the world isnt it one offends and otherspay for it i daresay it works well in the end as it teaches them andthe rest not to have to do with those who do offendi thank the king i said thinking to myself that it was not strangethat my heart had been so heavy in my celldont thank me for i owe you a good dealtake a cup of wine wontyou and look at the carving on that goblet before you drink for itis beautiful of the third dynasty of ur see the lion we cant dosuch work nowadays fill mine first that i may drink to show you itisnt poisoned i have never poisoned a man yet which is more thanmost kings can sayi did as he bade me and we both dranknow listen he went on as he set down his cup your real name isnot ptahmes but ramose of whom before you appeared here as a spy ihave heard as a scholar and a collector in cyprus for i know thenames of all the really learned men dont deny it for i have just hada private talk with my old friend belus of course i know that you arenot a spy you are a son of apries are you not one of whom that dogamasis wishes to be rid because of the blood in you which he and hisson have not got also for other reasonsit is so o king yet of old days this amasis showed himself a goodfriend to me because i pleased him as a soldier though once since hebecame pharaoh when in his cups he did threaten my life at my owntable now if he would have me killed i think it is for anotherreasonperhaps ramose who knows the reasons of such a lowbred man theyare as hidden as his parents but this i can tell you through thosewho serve him in this kingdom he caused me to be warned that you werea dangerous fellow believed to be the bearer of forged writingspurporting to appoint you an envoy from egypt to cyrus the persianwhereas really you were in the pay of the said cyrusit is false o king let the writings that have been taken from mebe carefully examined and it will be seen that they are not forgedalso i was forced to this embassy why i have learned todaywhich if you had carried out you would have found an evil one fordoubtless cyrus is also warned against you oh your amasis is a rathe is afraid of babylon and he is also afraid of the persians withmore reason perhaps for i think their star rises in the easttherefore he tries to play off one against the other and to pretendhimself the friend of both but tell me ramose if you thoughtyourself an ambassador to cyrus what were you doing making secretinquiries in damascusi sought one whom i had lost o kingso i have learned you and no other are the same ramose who is thehusband of that most beauteous lady who today was delivered to me asa wife to bribe me to a friendship with egypt but who it seems wasstolen from you by amasis pretending that he believed her to be yourdaughter and therefore with royal blood in her had i seen belus firstand known all the story never would i have accepted her but i didnot until it was too late and she was so exceedingly fair that for aflash of time i thought myself young again as old men do at momentsand received her in the ancient accepted fashion which perchance yousawyes i saw it all i answered with a groantherefore ramose it is finished he went on for even a king ofbabylon with all his power cannot hand over to any other man a womanwhom once he has publicly acknowledged as his wife because if he didso he would earn the curse of the godsor of their priestsandbring contempt and mockery upon his name yet i have done what i couldfor you and her i have placed her in the keeping of the holy saintwho confounded one that went before me and who is feared and honouredthroughout my kingdom as a mighty magician a halfgod not of it butdwelling on the earth with him she will be safe for there are no menin his house where even the boldest dare not molest her no notbelshazzar himselfwhile i live he added slowly as though to warnmestill our case is evil o king who are wed and love each other andyet under pain of death must always be separatefor a while the old man went on munching the brown barley bread withhis toothless gums and gazing at me then he saidperhaps not quite so evil as you think friend ramose listen i willtell you what i hide even from my physicians and astrologers from thephysicians because they cannot help me from the astrologers becauseit will save them and their stars the trouble of providing favourableomens and interpretations that will never be fulfilled i shall not behere long friend ramose at least above the ground at times my heartseems to stop especially if i am hurried or angered and i descendinto a pit of blackness and walk upon the edge of death it did sowhen i learned of the trick of amasis and again now for an instantwhen i grew wrath because belshazzar for some dark reason of his ownhad commanded that you should be killed against my will well soon ithink i shall walk over that edge and there will be an endmay the gods forbid it may the king live for ever i saidearnestly for forgetting its own troubles my heart went out towardsthis kindly old man to whom majesty brought so little joymay the gods do nothing of the sort egyptian for i think a fate isfalling upon babylon which i do not wish to live to see while i havestrength i cling to the throne that if i can i may shield her fromthe folly of those who refuse to make peace with this upstart persiancyrus who is yet a great man when i am gone let belshazzar and hisyoung counsellors follow their own road to ruin i read in your eyesthat you are honest also belus has made report to me of you were itotherwise i should not speak thus with a stranger but it seems thatafter all you are only a flatterer like the rest with yourmay theking live for ever being wise you know that kings do not live forever unless indeed that is the lot of all elsewhere still i forgiveyou who being much shaken and afraid seek to speak smooth thingsit is true pardon me o kinglet it be and hearken when a king of babylon dies the ancient andinviolable law is loosed and within a year the women of hishousehold save the mother of the new king may marry and go wherethey will then will be your opportunity as regards this lady myra ifyou can win her out of the grasp of any who would hold her fast inbabylon and especially of one whom i will not name who desires herand as i hear already has sworn to take her therefore you must stayon here in this city where your goods shall be restored to you with mypardon for all that you may have done it is in the hands of the godsmay they give you strength and wisdom meanwhile keep to your falsename of ptahmes and if you would live let none guess that you areramose the husband of myra i have spoken now let us talk aboutother thingsthen dismissing my private business to which he had given so muchthought in the goodness of his kind heart he began to speak wiselyenough of the old gods whose images stood about in this chamber oftheir history and worshippers of the cities where he had found themof the temples that he had built or restored and i know not whatbesidesas it chanced of many of these matters i knew a great deal havingstudied the attributes of the gods of many lands comparing them onewith another and tracing their rise and fall with that of thecountries or cities which worshipped them or how they changed theircharacters and names as it might suit their priests to make them doso it came to pass that we talked on as learned man to learned manuntil at length the dusk began to gather and i saw that the old kinggrew weary for he leaned back in his chair put his hand upon hisheart closed his eyes and sighed i watched him anxiously andespecially a blue tinge which appeared upon his lips not knowing whatto do who was sure that if he died when i was alone with him itwould be laid to my door and my life would pay the pricepresently however he recovered and ordered me to strike upon a bellwhich stood near by instantly attendants and guards appeared who allthis while had been gathered without and with them one of his privatescribesto this man the king dictated words which he wrote down they were anorder of pardon to me ptahmes the egyptian or rather a declarationof my innocence of all that was laid to my charge also a decree thati should be set at liberty furnished with apartments in the palaceand sustenance as the kings guest and have right of access to theking at all times that he could receive me this writing he sealed induplicate with his own seal and gave one copy of it to me commandingthat the other should be made known to all the officers and governorsof the palace and of babylon and then filed in the temple of mardukthat thenceforward i might be safe in my going out and my coming inand that everyone might do me reverence as the kings friendthese things done he waved his hand thus bidding me farewell and iwas led away no longer as a prisoner but with every honour thesoldiers saluting and eunuchs and chamberlains bowing down before mesuch were the changes of fortune that i experienced on this my firstday in babylon and such were the strange happenings that befell methey led me to beautiful apartments high up in the old part of thepalace that as i was told in the days of dead kings had served asthe lodgings of envoys from foreign courts here i found all my goodsand with them the gold that had been taken from me yes to the lastpiece and even the letters of amasis and his officers that shouldhave brought about my death though these were given to me laterhaving been acquitted and honoured by the king everything against mewas forgotten i was as another man palace servants waited on mebringing delicate food and wine palace minstrels played upon manystrange instruments while i ate even palace dancing girls appeared inlight attire but these i sent away being in no mood for theirblandishmentsi ate or pretended to eat because i was ashamed to refuse the foodwith so many eyes watching me i drank as much as i should drink orperhaps more because i needed the comfort of wine and afterwards satand brooded alone at an open windowplace thence i could see much ofthe mighty city of babylon over which shone the full moon thetowering temples the gleaming river the vast encircling walls thepalaces the gardens the populous streets whence rose the hum of amillion voices the flaring signal fires and cressets upon pinnaclesand pillars and a thousand other spectacles that were new to mebut these moved me not for always my eyes wandered over the sea ofroofs wondering beneath which of them dwelt that piercingeyed oldman the prophet daniel or belteshazzar of whom such marvelloustales were told and with him myra my hearts desirenow that i thought of it belus had spoken to me of this magician longago saying that he had interpreted the dreams of nebuchadnezzar yeseven when the king had forgotten what they were and thereby had savedthe lives of all the wise men and seers whom in his fury the kingpurposed to put to death also interpreting another dream he hadtold him that because he thought himself greater than god god wouldmake him as a beast in the field so that he would run about naked inhis garden and eat herbs like a beast this indeed came to pass sincebefore his end nebuchadnezzar was smitten with madness yet he greatlyhonoured daniel or belteshazzar as he was named in babylonworshipping him as one divine and promoted him to be the ruler ofbabylon after the king a rank that it seemed he still retained atleast in name therefore myra was more safe with him than any otheryet was she safe remembering the devouring glance and the words ofthe fierceeyed belshazzar the real king of babylon i asked myselfoh was she safewhy notif this daniel were the servant and minister of the true godand could throw his mantle over her but was there any true god whohad power in a world where dwelt so many devils alas i did not knowwho for all my seeking had never found him though at times it istrue i thought that i had kissed his feetthere came a challenge at my door where it seemed a guard was set aword spoken the rattle of a sheathed sword and the clank of bolts aman entered looking about him as he moved his head the lamplight fellupon his face and i saw that it was belus i remember that i ran andthrew my arms around him and that he kissed me on the brow as afather might do for indeed he was the only true father i had everknown then having made sure that we were alone we sat down andtalkedfortune has not gone so ill with us ramose or rather ptahmes forthat name is safer here he said when a while ago we were parted onthat journey to seleucia i scarcely thought to see you again livingthey seized me and to save myself from death i declared to the kingsscribe who accompanied them what i have hid even from youmy truelineage which is high enough seeing that through my mother the kingnabonidus and his son belshazzar are my kinsmen also i showed my rankas a priest of ishtar and one of the first of the college ofastrologers and proved what i said by a certain writing and by tokensthat i carry hidden about methey bowed before those holy tokens and instantly i was hurried awayin a chariot that i might be brought into the presence of the kingand my tale confirmed by the councils of the priests and theastrologers at babylon i prayed earnestly that you might come with mebut it was not allowed which had not my spirit told me otherwisewould have caused me to believe that you were dead for of your fatethey would say nothingi reached babylon before you travelling very swiftly by the kingsposts and though i could not see nabonidus my cousin because he wassick and might not be disturbed i appeared before the councils amongwhom were men who had known me well in my youth i was given back myrank among the companies of the priests and the watchers of the starswhich indeed i had never forfeited as the records showed who had leftthe land by the leave of nebuchadnezzar to gather learning in othercountries which i might share with my companions in babylon as i havedone year by year so very swiftly as though it had been decreed allwent well with me and now once more i am a man of high rank andstation in the great city also as it chances a relative by blood ofthat king of kings who today sits upon the throneand how did you learn what had happened to me and to myra belusi made inquiry but having so little time could discover nothingbecause your fate after you were taken prisoner was not yet known andof myra who came to be wife to the king if any knew they would notspeak because of the strange laws of babylon as to the women of theroyal household not till early this same morning was i sure that youwere in babylon and because the matter was urgent would at once bebrought before the king for judgment also that afterwards the royallady as they thought her who had been sent from egypt to be wife tothe king would be presented to him in the presence of the councillorsand nobles that the friendship between babylon and egypt might bethus publicly proclaimed i strove to see you and to send a letter tomyra but it was impossible for both of you were too closely guardedi strove to see the king but this also was impossible for havingbeen sick he was still asleep and would not rise from his bed tillthe hour came for him to attend the court as by good fortune he hadsuddenly determined to do at the time of the uttering of judgments tosettle some matters concerning a holy statue about which there wastrouble because it had been brought to babylon do you know the restyes belus for after my trial i was hidden away high up in a secretgallery of the women where i could see all and hear every word thatpassed i tell you when i beheld myra standing beneath me in herbeauty and saw that old king so moved by it that he forgot his yearsand weakness and descending from his throne embraced her therebyreceiving her as a wife according to the ancient customs i thoughtthat my heart would burst oh why did she not speak sooner for thenbeing goodhearted he might have spared herdoubtless because it was so fated ramose for her goodand yourown if the king had rejected her as some common cheat trapped out toape a royal lady she would have been driven from the presence to fallinto the hands of the first who chose to take her whose would theyhave been ramosedo you mean those of the prince belshazzar i askedyes i do ramose i have known him from his boyhood and i tell youhe is not a man but a tiger who loves to prey upon fair women inparticular upon those who hate and fly from him you heard the tale itold the king ramose it was belshazzar who stole my daughter andafterwards murdered her no other manfor a while he paused and there was silence for i knew not what tosay then his withered face and quiet eyes seemed to take fire and hewent onramose as you know i am by nature gentle one who can forgive andfind excuse for almost every sin because i understand the hearts ofmen but this prince i never can forgive who as it chances knows allthe horror of his crime and what he caused that poor maid of mine tosuffer before he butchered her towards him i am a minister ofvengeance appointed by god aye through all these years while idwelt so peacefully with you i have awaited my hour sure that itwould come and now i think it is at hand though still i know nothow doubtless he will try to kill me because he fears me whom he hasso deeply wronged but he will not succeedhe paused again then saidlet my troubles be a while we will speak of yours or rather ofours as he dealt with my daughter so will belshazzar deal with myraif he can having seen her beauty of which he had been told he willsurely try to take her indeed at the court i read it in his eyes andheard him say as much after the king had goneas i did i broke in with a groannow went on belus when i learned these things from those who hadbeen friends to me in the days of my youth also that it wasimpossible that i could speak or write you or myra before the sittingof the court i went back to my chamber and prayed for help to thespirit of wisdom whom i worship so earnestly did i pray that afaintness came over me and all grew dark to my eyes then on theblackness or so it seemed to me appeared one word in the chaldeanwriting namely daniel my mind returned to me and i wondered who orwhat was daniel till presently i remembered that daniel was the nameof a certain highborn captain of the people of judah he whomnebuchadnezzar advanced to great honour giving him the new name ofbelteshazzar by which thenceforth he was known in babylon also i wassure that this man was brought to my mind because from him there mightcome help in my troublei went out and having inquired where dwelt the lord and prophetbelteshazzar i ran as never i have run before to his house which isnear to the southern gate as i reached it daniel himself came outfrom the courtyard riding on a mule for after all these years i knewhim again i craved speech of him and at first he answeredfriend i go to my garden without the wall there to rest and prayif you have business with me i beg you to come at another timelord and prophet i answered the business is most urgent thenseeing that he was still minded to go on i added it has to do withone of the blood of judahwhy did you say that i asked of belus was it only because youthought he would listen to nothing elsenay ramose it was because myra as i have long been sure is ofthat race did not her dying mother tell you so is not her name thatof a woman of israel are not hebrew characters of which the meaningis hid from me engraved upon the emerald amulet she wears which hermother gave to you with the jewels is not her appearance that of anoble and beautiful lady of the children of judah as you say was thatof her mother before her at least i did say it and the prophethearkened dismounting from his mule he led me into the house andthere in a small room where stood many written rolls upon shelves ibrought myself to his mind and told him all our storywhat would you have me do belus he asked when it was finishedit is true that i am still named governor of babylon but my worddoes not run against the kings and it is belshazzar the kings sonnot belteshazzar the prophet who today has power in this evil cityi do not know i answered who am i that i should instruct thegreatest seer in babylonyou tell me that you prayedto what god i am not sureand that myname came to your mind o belus well the example is good and i willfollow it asking for light wait here a while and be silentthen he went to a windowplace that jutted from the wall of the roomand knelt down by the open window to pray and watching his face fromwhere i sat i saw that it shone as it were with light from withinyes it shone like a lamp so that i grew sure that his god wasspeaking to him if this were so he did not tell me what he hadlearned for when he rose from his knees all he said wasi will not ride to my garden this day though that is a sorrow to mewho longed for its peace nay i will attend the court and there abidewhat may happencannot you see the king at once o prophet i askedno it is impossible unless i am summoned moreover no such counselhas come to me you are an astrologer and a priest of marduk are younot if so go dress yourself in the robes of your office or of yourfalse god and as you have a right to do attend at the court where ithink you will be neededmy false god i answered well at least he led me to you oprophet tell me then who is the true god for him i have sought allmy lifemayhap to find him at last to whom you draw near for otherwise yourprayer would not have been answered but of these matters we willspeak afterwards go now and do those things which your heart teachesyou go and swiftly for time pressesso i went and what happened afterwards you know ramose                             chapter xvi                          ramose is temptednow for a while in this story of mine little happened that is worththe telling belus and i dwelt together in the palace as we wereallowed to do by the decree of the king of myra we saw nothing for itwas impossible to come at her in this business the prophet daniel orbelteshazzar was as a rock that cannot be moved or pierced by thehelp of belus i saw and talked with him though not in his own houseshowing him how hard was our case and praying him at least to carry aletter from me to myra he listened with a courteous patience thenanswerednoble egyptian ramose hear my counsel first of all forget for awhile that you are an egyptian that your real name is ramose and notptahmes and most of all that you have had anything to do with a ladycalled myra who chances to be in my charge as titular governor ofbabylon and a prophet beloved by the king at present all this is notknown or has been forgotten and you are thought of only as astranger suspected in error and one admitted to the friendship of theking because you are very learned in ancient histories and religionswhich it pleases him to study at least they are not known tobelshazzar the prince and the king to be who believes that the mansaid to have married the lady myra before the pharaoh tried to palmher upon nabonidus as a maiden of the royal house is some noble ofegypt who still dwells in that country were it otherwise i thinkthat you would not live long ramose for belshazzar has many servantsin whose hands are daggers and no longer does he cause his victims tobe thrown into the great river unweighted with stones here heglanced at belus who was with meall these things may be so prophet i said yet why should i notsee my wife in private or at the least write to herhas not the king told you he answered sternly then once and forall i will because i have passed my word that no man should do sowhile the king lives o ramose and the word of belteshazzar stillknown as the governor of babylon may not be broken well is it foryou that this is so and for the lady myra also twice already has theroyal prince belshazzar sent his commands to me under sealdemanding that i should suffer him to capture this lady by allowingher to walk abroad beyond the shelter of my walls which are sacred tothe babylonians aye more sacred than the sanctuaries of their owntemples or at the least that i should give him access to her boththese commands i defied thereby earning his added hate and threats ofvengeance can i then grant to you what i have refused the heir tobabylon can i even allow writings to pass between you which if theywere found would mean the death of both and my dishonourat least tell me of her prophet for that is not against your vowi said humblyhe thought a while then answeredi may say thisshe is well and after a fashion happy who hasescaped great danger if only for a while also for other reasonswhat other reasonsone of them is that she has learned with certainty of what blood shecomes through her mother it is high for this mother as she told youat her death was truly the daughter of zedekiah the last king ofjudah who when he fled from jerusalem towards jordan took her withhim a little maid he was captured and brought to riblah with a greatnumber of the people of israel here nebuchadnezzar in his ragebecause he had rebelled against him caused his sons to be slainbefore his face then he blinded him and brought him as a slave tobabylon where for years he lay a prisoner in the dungeons of yondertemple till at length his misery was ended in death but the girl wasspared for she showed promise of beauty and was afterwards given tothe prince merodach you know the end of that story ramose for yousaw her die in blood as her brothers died and took away her babe andreared ithow do you know these things prophet i asked eagerlyin sundry ways ramose when i was young i knew her mother and thatshe was killed in the battle between merodach and the egyptians inwhich you took part also i know the emerald seal she wears that hascut on it the name of god in ancient hebrew characters which i canread it is an old seal and has a long history i remember it when ithung about the neck of myras mother as it did on that of her motherbefore her moreover the truth of all this matter has been revealed tome without doubt this lady myra is descended from zedekiah the weakand the accursed and as i think is the last of his race leftlivingit seems that i have a wife of high lineage i said well i heardas much before from the lips of the dying mysia but scarcely believedit who thought that perhaps her mind wanderedaye ramose too high for safety who on both sides is of the race ofkings still it has made her happy to learn the truth because shethinks that this will please you who have wed one of whom you need notbe ashamed she is happy also because now i am leading her to worshipthe god of her fathers whom i serve and lastly because she knows thatyou live in this same city and believes that he will throw his shieldover you and her and keep you safe for ramose day and night shethinks of you and prays to god for younow when i heard this my heart melted in me with love and longing sothat almost with tears i implored the prophet that even if i might notspeak or write to her he would suffer me to look on myra with myeyes at length he yieldedhearken he said behind my house there is a little garden throughwhich runs a channel of water planted on its banks with willow treesbeneath these willows myra sits in the cool of the afternoon readingor doing such tasks as please her now overlooking this garden isanother house that the king gave to me together with that in which idwell where at times i shelter those of my race who need it todayit is empty belus shall lead you there and from its upper windowhidden yourself behind the shutter you may look on myra although shewill not know that your eyes behold her this you may do on one day inevery seven that which is our sabbath and no more swearing to methat you will not attempt to call to her or show yourself and thisfor your sake as well as hers also for the sake of me and of my oathbabylon is full of spies o ramose and were it known that a man wasso much as gazing upon a lady of the kings household who is in mycharge it would bring death to him and perhaps to her with muchtrouble upon me swear now and leave meso i swore and wentthe fourth day from that of my meeting with the prophet who was calledbelteshazzar was that of the sabbath of the worshippers of jehovahand until it came it is true that i scarcely ate or slept because thedesire to behold myra burned me up at noon on that day when menrested in the fierce heat and few were in the streets save beggars andothers who slept in such shade as they could find belus and iwrapped in the cloaks worn by the poorer class of traders in babylonmade our way to the house of which the prophet had spokenpassing to the back of this house which was set almost against thewall of an old and deserted building once occupied by priests andtherefore for some superstitious reason no longer dwelt in byothers belus led me to a secret entrance that could only be reachedthrough the wall and doubtless was used by the priests for their ownpurposes when they owned this house in ancient days at least therewas the narrow hidden door that he unlocked with a strange key andbeyond it a dark and twisting passage leading to the cellars of thehouse whence a stair or rather a ladder ran to the floor abovelocking the door behind us we climbed this ladder and came to astairway of brick that led to the upper rooms for like many of thehouses of babylon where land was precious this was built in severalstoreysentering a room that was well but plainly furnished we found in it awindowplace projecting from the wall of the house around which werefixed wooden shutters whereof the bars that were many opened uponhinges to admit air and to enable those in the room to look out whilstthey remained unseen from belowbelus went to this windowplace and tilting up one of the shutterbars showed me that beneath us at a distance of not more than ten ortwelve paces lay an enclosed garden such as the prophet haddescribed of which the house formed a boundary wall there was thestream or rather ditch of water planted with flowering lilies thatfloated on its surface there were the willow trees with their weepingbranches in which birds were nesting and there beneath them were lowcushioned seats and a rough table of woodhere in this chamber we waited a long while till at length the greatsun turned towards the west and the city around us awakening from itsmidday sleep began to hum with life then at last we saw white handspart the willow branches and a tall figure glide across a littlebridge of planks and enter the green arbour as we could do easilybecause the branches did not grow thickly towards the blank wall ofour house where there was little light and no sun it was myramyraherself clad in simple white robes on which hung a single ornamentthe lilybloom enclosed in crystal but looking more beauteous in themeven than she had done when arrayed in jewels and glorious apparelshe was brought into the palace halls of babylon to be presented toits kingfor a space she stood motionless gazing at the lilies floating uponthe water almost was i tempted to call to her indeed i think ishould have done so had not belus guessing my purpose whispered inmy earremember your oathi bit my lips and kept silenceshe sighedi could hear her sigh then sinking down upon the cushionsshe bent forward and drew one of the floating lily blooms towards heras though to pluck it if so she changed her mind for she loosed itand taken by the current it swung back to its place then she liftedthe crystal from her breast studied the flower within pressed it toher lips and letting it fall began to weep very softly a sight thati could scarcely bearat length she paused and wiping away her tears sank to her knees upona cushion and prayed aloud but in so low a voice that i could hearlittle of what she said still i caught some words such asgod ofmy fathers god above all gods thou that hast power even in mightybabylon and over the hearts of its princes   then came murmurings not to be distinguished and after them thesewords spoken more clearly as though the weight of sorrow pressed themfrom her heart   ramose my most beloved he from whom i have been stolen myhusband whom my arms ache to hold oh bring me to him or let me dielet me not be defiled by the touch of this vile prince who seeks menay rather let me die clean and wait till ramose comes to join me inthe graveshe ceased her pitiful prayer pressed the crystal case passionatelyagainst her lips once more and drawing a roll from a satchel that shehad with her began to readnot for long did she read for presently she threw down the rollpressed her hands upon her heart as though to still its beating andglanced about her wideeyed while the colour came and went upon hercheeksthen i knew that she felt me near to her yes that love opened somedoor in her breast through which had entered a knowledge that hersenses could not seize in her agitation she spoke to herself in a lowand thrilling whisper that floating on the still air reached mefaintly in the windowplacei feel ramose near me she said is he dead does his loosed spiritspeak with mine yet captive in the flesh nay it is his living lovethat beats upon me wave after wave of it filling the cup of my hearti dream i dream oh would that the dream might last for ever for init his lips touch mine that hunger for them oh ramose my loveramose my own come to me ramose and not in dreamssuch words as these she murmured and others that i could not catchnow i was gripped by mad temptation a strong creeping plant fromwhose woody stems hung masses of blue flowers climbed up the wall andpast our windowplace by aid of which it would not be difficult todescend into that garden in the fury of my great desire honour andall else was forgotten i would descend i would be with her if onlyfor a breath i would hold her in my arms though my life should pay theforfeit might i not take my own already staggering like a drunkenman i was at the shutter purposing to push it back when i heard thevoice of belus whisperremember your oath ramose shall it be written that you are a liarby the gods no i answered huskily let us go before i fallwith one last glance at the passionate loveliness of myra who seemedto have taken fire from the power of her living dream and now stoodglancing about her with parted lips and heaving breast i turnedcursing my fate and reeled towards the doorway behold in it stood aman the prophet himself he gazed at me sternly yet with a littlesmile playing about the corners of his thin mouthyou have fought well ramose and gained a victory that one dayshould not lack for its rewardnot i but belus i mutterednay belus did but give tongue to your own conscience learn that hadyou yielded what you sought would never have been yours though nonecan hear her words eyes other than your own the eyes of women and ofeunuchs watch that lady always from a hidden place when she isunguarded in the garden and had a man been seen to join her shewould have been dragged away to suffer the fate of those who arefaithless to the king yes to die by fire or wateror if hisofficers were very merciful to be mutilated and made hideous andthus cast upon the streets where you would never find her for youwould be deadi shivered for myra not for myself because at that moment i thoughtdeath would be better than so much suffering then words came to meand i saidi have gone near to great evil i pray your pardon for being but aman prophet unless you bid me i will come to this place no morelest once again passion should lead me whither i would not go if youmay tell myra that i have seen her and aught else that you thinkwise for it is not in the heart of woman to think the worse of onewho has done wrong because he loves her overmuchso be it he answered still smiling faintly and thus we partedthus it came about that until fate drove me there i came to thathouse no morenow i have to tell of the death of nabonidus for many weeks i dwelton in the palace and almost every day this kindly old king save whenhe was too ill or too troubled with the affairs of state sent for meand sometimes for belus his cousin also to talk with him about suchmatters as the learned love it was strange to see him still one ofthe mighty monarchs of the world caring for none of its glorieshating them even turning his back upon high officers and lovelywomen upon the pomp jewels and worship which in the east are offeredto the king to give all his time and thought to the study of ancientwritings or forgotten temples and to the history and attributes of athousand gods yet such was the pleasure of this shrewd but innocentmind and to it i was a minister indeed had i chosen i might havebecome great in babylon for he would have heaped on me any wealth andoffices that i desired but i did not choose who sought above allthings to remain humble and unknownso under the name of ptahmes by which i had passed since i enteredbabylonia i remained in the palace as did scores of others to whomit pleased the king to give hospitality in that vast building whichcovered almost as much ground as does the great pyramid near memphishere i gave out that i was an egyptian born of a cyprian mother atnaukratis in the delta a man of independent means who followed afterlearning and in its pursuit wandered from land to land desiring tosee them and to study their customs and peoples that i might write ofthem in a book this tale was accepted readily enough for since i hadbeen acquitted by the king and admitted to his friendship theaccusation against me of being a spy in the pay of egypt or of persiawas forgotten as soon most things were in the vast metropolis ofbabylon a city where memories were very short especially concerningthose whom it pleased the king to favour so i dwelt in peaceconsorting only with a few other learned men to whom belus made meknown as a friend of his with whom he had studied at naukratis inegypt for now belus had recovered the lost ties of his youth and wasaccepted everywhere as a noble of babylon a blood relation of theking a priest of the gods and an astrologer of high degreehere i should say that shortly after i had seen myra in the prophetsgarden belshazzar the kings son and heir left babylon at the headof a great army to wage war against cyrus the persian who wasthreatening the empire and while his enemy was away belus was saferthan he had been before therefore he too remained at peace in thecity why he did so i was not sure seeing that the place was stillperilous for him when i asked him he said that he would not leave meand myra with whom his lot was intertwined and when i pressed himfurther that he was commanded to bide here by the stars which heconsulted after the fashion of the great astrologers of babylonyet all the while i knew that he was hiding his true reason in thosedays there was something fateful even terrible about belus often iwatched the old man pretending to read or to consult mysterious signswritten upon skins or tablets and noted that his mind was far awaythere he sat like a sphinx his lips pressed together his eyes coldand fixed staring out at nothingness and his face grown fierce asthat of a lion which scents its preyat such times if i spoke to him all this would fall from him like amask the eyes twinkled the face grew friendly and a smile appearedaround the lips where it was wont to be so that i wondered which wasthe real appearance and which the mask little did i know of the greatschemes that seethed in the heart of belus of the mighty plots hewove in his cunning brain and of the terrible revenge he planned orwhy at night he met many of the great ones of babylon now here and nowthere and talked with them secretlywhen i asked him of these meetings he answered that those great lordsand priests came together to consult their stars as indeed in a sensethey did to this i said nothing though i thought it very strange thatmen however gifted should be able to consult stars on nights of fullmoon when the sky was almost as bright as day or as i knew sometimeswas the case in vaults beneath the piledup mass of templesin the beginning i was vexed who felt that for the first time for manyyears belus had drawn a veil between us hiding his secrets from mebut after thought i grew sure that this must be for some good reasonso it was in truth for as i learned later he held that there wasmuch passing in babylon which it would be dangerous for me to knowbecause those who knew might suddenly find themselves face to facewith deathon a certain day when as was common i had been summoned by one ofhis chamberlains to wait upon nabonidus in the private chamber wherehe studied surrounded by the statues of gods and other relics ofantiquity i found the old king much changed in body he seemed weakerthan i had ever known him he could scarcely rise from his chairwithout my help and to do so left him almost breathless for a whilei asked if he were ill and if so why he did not summon his physicianno not ill friend for so he often called me now but onlyburning out physicians cannot help me and i will have no more ofthem indeed for the matter of that i have seen belus my cousin andyour companion who having studied in egypt among the greeks knowsmore than do most of those in babylon who doctor men according totheir reading of the stars or the divinations of those who consultomenswhat did belus tell you o kingnothing friend he bade me open my robe and set his ear against mynaked breast and listened to my heart then he shook his head and wassilent and i knew that the day of my fate was upon memay the king live for ever i murmured in the accustomed form notknowing what else to sayaye he answered smiling so long as it is not in another babylonbeyond the gates of darkness friend i must go as all these havegone and he pointed to the statues of dead monarchs that stood aboutthe room and to the writings sealed with their seals i will tell youthe truth i am glad to go though i must be stripped of all my pompand power and pass naked to whence i camehe paused a while then went onegyptian they say that dying eyes see far and certainly i see muchwoe coming upon babylon or at the least upon her kings have you notheard of cyrus the persiani bent my headand have you heard that this great man for he is great has but nowdefeated belshazzar my son at opis and threatens zippari have not heard it o kingyet it is so for swift posts have brought the news doubtless soonhis armies will threaten babylon aye and as i think take it forboth the people and the army hate the prince my son and will fightfor him but feebly making an end of my house and its rule andperchance of the ancient city queen of the world alsoagain he paused and presently continuedif so she has brought it on her own head for i tell you egyptianthat babylon is evil aye she is a bladder filled with sin and theblood of peoples a bladder waiting to be pricked belshazzar toohe added with passion my son who already rules the empire in all butname is an evil man from his boyhood up he has been turbulentlustful cruel and bloody one who wades through death to his desiresa tyrant a betrayer of his friends moreover it is too late for himto change who is past his fiftieth year how long will the gods bearwith such a man against our foes he might fight for the empire stillis mighty but can he fight the enemies in his own house i tell youthe people murmur against him and the nobles plot to overthrow himwhen i am gone so let me go where being innocent i hope for peaceblessed are the dead for they sleep or if they wake of earth and itstroubles they know no morethus he spoke in a voice that grew faint and yet fainter till it endedin a kind of wail and died into silence so that i thought he wasabout to swoon but it was not so for presently he recovered hisstrength and saidi talk much of myself as is the fashion of the aged and of what ifear or feel forgetting that others also have evils to bear and faceyou for example friend let me think what were they oh i rememberthat beauteous woman whom the dog amasis tried to palm off on me as aprincess of egypt but who it seems is a private lady and your wifeor so you and belus swear i hear she swears it also but in suchmatters none can believe what comes out of a womans mouth thebusiness is unhappy could i have my will you might take her at onceand welcome but here i face a rock which even the king cannot movenamely the law concerning the ladies of the royal household on whichone might think that the whole empire of babylon was built moreoversomeone is at work in this matter for when on your behalf and hersthat old prophet of judah put it into my mind to try to find a wayround this rock all paths were blocked i know not by whomperhaps by the prince belshazzar i hazardedit may be so indeed it is very likely for belshazzar is alwayscoveting this one or that even though they be of his fathershousehold at any rate in name well i say that the way is blockedand if i tried to force a path the priests would stir as though aninsult had been done to their gods yes there would be scandals andtalk of impiety by an unbelieving king that would serve the purposeof the plotters against my house among the vulgar and i know not whatbesides so nothing can be donethat is sad for me and my wife i said sighingyes of course though it it strange that it should be so there areso many women in the world that it seems foolish for a man to breakhis heart over any one of them when doubtless a fairer awaits him inthe next street also there is hope in the case much trouble hasarisen about this lady with egypt against whom because of herbabylon has threatened war now amasis the pharaoh pretending to beinsulted and believing you the husband to be deadi thought itwell for your own sake to tell him that the man who bore forgedletters to cyrus of whom he warned us had been caught and executed asa spydemands that his daughter as he calls her should be sent backto him with a great present of gold yet this cannot be done for thereason i have told you namely that she has been taken into the royalhouseholdthen it seems there is an end o kingnot so for have i not told you friend that even in babylon kingsdo not live for ever when i die my household is dissolved at leastafter a time and i shall die soon therefore because you are abrother scholar who has solaced my last months i have made a plan toserve you as this lady and i have never met but once and that in opencourt i have issued a royal decree that immediately upon my death sheshall be set at liberty and sent back to egypt with all her belongingsand a gift moreover i have appointed that you under the name ofptahmes by which you are called here for none know you to be herhusband and belus shall accompany her as you also wish to return toegypt in safety though if you are wise neither of you will set footin that land while amasis reigns no when you have crossed theborders of this country and are free you will turn and fly whitheryou will out of reach of amasis and of belshazzarthere that is all i am weary the decree has been registered in dueform sealed with my own seal and you will find a copy of it in yourlodgings for it was given to belus only today that it might notmiscarry farewell friend your theory of the beginning of the godsis most wise and pregnant soon i shall learn whether it be truefarewell and may all good fortune be yours when you are as old as iam think sometimes of nabonidus whom they called a king but who knewhimself to be a ruler of nothing no not even of his own heart hochamberlain take me hence i would sleep                             chapter xvii                         at the western gatewhat nabonidus promised me he performed in my lodgings i found beluswaiting with the writings under the royal seal whereby he and i weregiven safe conduct to leave babylon when we would and go whither wewould which writings all the officers of the empire were commanded toobey in them however nothing was said concerning myra i askedbelus what this meant and whether i had been tricked he answered nofor other writings had been sent to the prophet daniel orbelteshazzar as he knew from his own lips commanding him so soon asthe news of the death of the king should reach him to hand over myrawith her woman named metep to an escort charged to conduct her to thefrontiers of the land and there leave her to await the coming ofanother escort from egypti listened and answered that i liked the plan littlewhere i asked must we meet myra and how were we to know when sheleft the prophets house also even if all should go well what wouldhappen when we came to the frontiers of the empire where perhaps shewould fall into the power of egyptians waiting to receive her and iwith her if so our case would be even worse than it was beforeramose answered belus we wander in the darkness of night and mustfollow the only star that we can see like you neither the prophetnor i think well of this plan yet if we do not act upon it which waycan we turn it is certain that while the king lives not even he cancommand that myra should be sent from babylonwhy not i asked angrilyi think that he has told you himself namely because he whose dutyit is to administer the law must not break the law moreover if hegave the order it would not be obeyed because under these sameancient statutes any man who touches or holds converse with a lady ofthe royal household is criminal an outcast to be slain by whoevercan or will once the king is dead it is otherwise for the edictswhich he has signed must be fulfilled unless indeed they are revokedby other edicts of the new kingwhich will surely happen belusaye it will happenif there is time for as i have heard from asure source belshazzar when in his cups gave out that so soon as hehad power he would certainly take this egyptian myra whom it was thepleasure of the king his father to keep from him and whom thereforehe desired more than any woman in the world indeed he is foolishabout the matter having been smitten by the sight of her beauty whenshe appeared at the court as though by a sword and as he sayswounded through the heart certainly had it not been for the law as tothe kings wives and still more because of his fear of the prophet inwhose holy charge she is already he would have seized and smuggledher awaythen this he will surely do as soon as the king is dead belusayei repeat if he has time but should nabonidus die soonbelshazzar is not in babylon with the remainder of his great army heis in zippar that cyrus besieges there perhaps he may be killed ormade prisoner or many things may happen also nabonidus is not yetdead he may pass at any minute or he may live for months as mensuffering from the heart sometimes do everything is dark anddoubtful still we must be prepared to act at any moment thereforelet us forget our fears and go straightforward though for my parthe added darkly i do not believe that fate will take me from babylontill a certain doom has been accomplishedthis then we did who could find no better counsel putting our faithin the goodness of god and trusting that we should find help in ourneedhaving wealth at our command we bought swift horses and hiredservants faithful men of israelite descent and free citizens whocould go where they would and who desired to leave babylon which menand horses we kept at hand in a safe place near to the western gatewhence we must start for egypt also belus devised a scheme whichprovided that metep should hang a cloth from a window of the prophetshouse telling us when her mistress was about to leave so that wemight be ready to start to join her and many other things we did thatneed not be toldat length nabonidus died very suddenly from the time that i had lastseen him he had kept his bed sleeping a great deal and paying no heedto anybody or anything that passed till on a certain afternoon herose saying that he felt quite well again and went to his favouritechamber that in which i was wont to visit him here while he waswalking up and down some message was brought to him by one of thegreat officers of which all we could learn was that it had to do withbelshazzar and the persian war whether the news was good or ill i donot know but this is certain that nabonidus said aloudit is the will of god my day of fate has comethen he set his hand upon his heart fell down groaned once anddiedsuch was the end of this weak but honest and kindly man a scholar ofwhom to his sorrow destiny had made a king over a doomed empire inone thing at least heaven was good to him he did not live to see itfallhaving bribed certain eunuchs and a scribe belus and i were among thefirst if not the very first to know that all was over that is savethe prophet who learned it in his spirit as he learned many thingsinstantly we rushed to the appointed place where our horses and goodsawaited us whence we could see the house of daniel and watchpresently at a window appeared a white cloth showing us that there tooall was known and that myra was about to start with her escortthis was the planthat we should stand to one side till she hadpassed the gate and follow with our men to the first camping placewhere we could discover ourselves to the captain of the escort who hadbeen warned that we should join him having authority under the sealof the late king and his vizier that we could show if there wereneed this we thought would be easy especially as the death ofnabonidus was not known in the city and perhaps might be kept from thepeople for hoursor dayswe came to the gate as the sun began to sink and waited as though forsome friend or other merchants to join us there for we were disguisedas traders at length through the gloom which gathered very quicklythat night because after some days of terrible heat the sky was fullof thunderclouds which were about to burst with beating hearts we sawa company coming down the street towards the gate that pierced themighty wall of babylon a captain rode ahead of it then camesoldiers a dozen or more of them and in their midst mounted uponwhite mules two veiled women one tall and graceful as a reed theother short and thick in body at the sight of whom my heart leapt fori knew them to be myra and old metep after these followed other mulesand asses laden with baggage tents and so forth and accompanied byservants as they passed us i saw the tall lady turn as though tostare at me through her veil then i was sure that myra had seen andknew me and bent my head a little which she answered by bendingherstonight i thought to myself with joy we may speak together in somecamp if no more tonight our troubles may be over and our longseparation endedat that moment while my heart was filled with this happy dream camethe first flash of the storm like a sword of fire it seemed to strikethe watch towers set upon the crest of the wall high above us and ina line of blinding light passed down the pillar of one of the innerbrazen gates into the earth with a noise and a shock that caused thehorses of the officer and some of the soldiers to wheel round andcharge back among those that followed confusion came and shoutingsfor all believed that men had been killed by the flame from heavenwhereas in fact one or two had been unhorsedno more then theclamour was covered and lost by the crash of thunder pealing overheadit died away and for a little while there was silence through which iheard the officer rallying his men with words of command no easymatter for they were entangled with the baggage animals whose driverswere frightened and knew not what to dothen i heard something else namely the sound of a horse gallopingthe lightning flashed again piercing the gloom it shone upon thegilded armour of a captain of the royal bodyguard riding at full speedwho as he passed me criedthe king is dead ho warden shut the gates that none may make itknown to the enemies of babylonthe officer in charge of the escort heard and strove to press forwardthrough the long archway of the wall before he was cut off too latewith a great clashing worked by their engines the outer gates ofbronze swung home in front of him he called for the warden of thegates and showed him a writing which it was too dark to read theywrangled together as belus and i who with our people had followedthem into the archway could hear there was great disorder somepressed forward and some pressed back for all who could had rushedinto the tunnel to escape the lightnings and the heavy rain that beganto fall men thrust horses neighed and trampled moving to and froand mingled together presently i found myself by the side of a figureclad in white which jostled against meyour pardon said a gentle voice and i knew it for that of myramyra i whispered it is iramoseoh my love my love she whispered back and next moment i had bentdown and was kissing her upon the lips cursing the veil that laybetween us yes and she was kissing me but one kiss and it was donefor we were thrust apart againthe tumult and wrangling increased the officer in charge of myrasescort demanded that the gates should be opened and threatened thewardens a loud voice criedin the name of belshazzar king of babylon it is commanded that noneleave babylonbetween the bellowings of the thunder i heard the clattering ofhorses hoofs and chariot wheels again a voice crieda woman of the royal household escapes seize her words at which myblood ran coldanother voice answeredthey are heretwo of themarmed men rushed upon the mob the escort gathered round myra andmetep whose white dresses could be seen dimly through the gloom andmore clearly when the lightning flashed i and my people did likewiseswords were drawn there was confused fighting a huge black man inbrazen armour seized myras mule by the bridle and began to drag itback towards the street metep screamed soldiers cursed i attackedthe black man he smote at me and missed i thrust my sword throughhis throat and he fell dead or dying others seized the woman thescene in that narrow place as the lightning showed it was terribleall shouted all smote scarcely knowing at whom they smote whilemetep still screamed long and loud my horse was thrust back againstthe bars of the gate plunging and kicking someone struck me on thehead i think with a club causing me to drop my sword and almoststunning me when my wits came again i was outside the archway in thenarrow street whither my horse had borne me following othersthe storm raged more fiercely than before and the rain poured downfar up the street i saw soldiers retreating and in the midst of themtwo figures in white the lightning showed them clearly also many menin flight in the darkness that followed the flash someone approachedand a voice spoke it was that of belusall is finished ramose he said the guards of the household ofbelshazzar have snatched away myra come now quickly before we areknown to have taken part in this tumult else we shall be seized andslain i have told our servants where they may find usstill dazed by the blow i followed him who knowing the city fromboyhood led me through a maze of streets where none was stirringbecause of the great storm and the darkness of the falling nightafter us came our servants or most of them and the laden beastswhere have they taken myra i asked with a groandoubtless to belshazzars palace he answered yet be comforted heis not in babylon she has been seized because of commands which heleft with his great officers who have watched the prophets house dayand night lest she should escapea curse is on us i muttered we are dogged by evil another hourand we had been free could not your spells have protected us for onehour belusthe tale is not yet finished he answered quietly mayhap this evilhas protected us from greater that we do not see mayhap it isappointed that we still have work to do in babylon whither i at leastmust have returned even if we had escaped tonight though this i hidfrom youhave done i exclaimed fiercely myra is in the house of belshazzarand who can save her nowgod he answered and was silentwhither go weto our lodgings i asked presentlynay it would not be safe we go to that house whence once you lookedupon a garden it is the prophets and holy ground which none daresviolate not even belshazzar because he believes that to do so wouldbring a curse and perhaps death upon him had it been otherwise myrawould have been seized long agoso broken in spirit for all seemed lost once again i entered thathebrew guesthouse by the secret way not caring whether or no i weredragged from it to my death indeed i was as a little child and didwhat belus bade me asking no questions he managed all findinglodging for the men in the outbuildings of the house bringing foodand i know not what besidesthat night the prophet came to us i looked up from the stool on whichi was seated my head resting on my hand and saw him standing beforeme tall blackrobed thinfaced darkeyed whitehaired more likea ghost than a man i would have risen to bow to him but he stayed mewith his handyou are weary he said and smitten to the heart rest where youare and listen all seems to have gone awry the lady myra my wardhas been snatched away and now as i have sure tidings is a prisoneramong the women of belshazzar and in his own palace which once wasthat of nebuchadnezzar the great king nor good old nabonidus beingdead can i take her hence for none so much as reads the edicts ofdeparted kings who prays to the sun that is sethow did it happen prophet i asked wearilythis house was watched he answered from the beginning belshazzarthe womanhunter having once seen her beauty determined to possesshimself of myra if ever she passed my doors which all babylonians holdinviolate when she went forth spies reported it to his officers orperhaps the hour of her going was already known through some traitorif so here and now i call down upon him the wrath of god and helifted his hand to heaven then bowed his head muttering some wordsat least she was taken as you saw for as is common the tidings ofthe death of a king the guardians closed the gates which they mustdo nor would it have helped if she had passed them for she wouldhave been followed and seized and you with her as it is both youand belus have escaped because you were not noted in the darkness ofthe archway as having fought against the guards of belshazzar ayeand slew their captain therefore you are safe here and in sanctuarywhere none dares to set a foot lest the curse of jehovah should fallupon him and here you must bide till all is accomplishedwhat will happen to myra i askedat presentnothing save that she will be fed on sweetmeatsperfumed with scents and purified according to the custom of thesebabylonian hogs with women who are dedicate to the king then at suchtime as he shall appoint she will be offered to him as a lamb isoffered upon an altar and if she pleases him be set high in hishousehold perhaps upon the throne itselfhearing these horrible words i went mad i raved i cursed yes ireviled this daniel or belteshazzaryou are reported a great prophet i said one who worships a justand mighty god that even the babylonians revere although he be butthe lord of a conquered captive people yet you tell me that such acrime will be worked upon an innocent woman because she is accursedwith great loveliness by a king who is but a brute in human shape ifyour god and hers be a true god as they say nebuchadnezzar held hewas let him manifest himself and save her his servant then i willworship him whom otherwise i name but another idolthe prophet looked at me and smiled a strange and quiet smilepoor man he said what do you know of god and of his ways thisday by the gate you slew a gallant soldier who did but obey his ordersto capture certain persons he had committed no sin he knew nothingof this business yet god suffered that you should drive your swordthrough his throat and bring him down to death unavenged for in thatdarkness none saw who smote himdid you see i asked angrilyperhaps with the eyes of my spirit or perhaps i learned itotherwise it matters nothing at least god commanded that he shouldbe slain we know not why so god has commanded that this woman of mypeople who is your wife should be captured we know not why yet itmay please him to save her at the last or it may not please him letthe scroll of fate unroll itself at the appointed time and bow yourhead before what is written therethen he lifted his hand as though in blessing and departedso it came about that i took up my abode with those servants whom wehad hired citizens of babylon but all of them of the israelite faithwho after what had happened at the gateway thought that they wouldbe safest here until they could leave the city with me or otherwisebut although he often came to visit me at night belus dwelt elsewherewith friends of his own now in one place now in another when iasked him why all he would say was that it must be so adding darklythat he was a marked man with many enemies and now that nabonidus wasdead if we consorted together i should be marked alsofor my part i was but little known and so long as i remained under theshelter of the prophets roof one who would not be harmed unless byevil fortune the kings council heard that it was i who had killed theofficer of the guard while attempting to aid the escape of thebeautiful egyptianso guessing that belus had other reasons as well as those which he setout i let the matter be though in truth my life in this place wasvery sad and lonely with no companion save my own thoughts which wereblack enough i did not dare to go abroad for the prophet forbade itand of the few learned men and royal servants whom i had met inbabylon while i waited on nabonidus none came to visit me indeedeither i was forgotten or believed to be dead or to have departedin babylon not many strangers were remembered even for a month amongthe thousands from all countries who came and went on the business oftheir trades or to visit the temples or study the wonders of themightiest city of the earth also now that nabonidus was dead hiscourt was dispersed and his great palace in which alone my face hadbeen seen stood empty for that of belshazzar the new king was inanother quarter of the city therefore i was quite unknown for asbelus told me the company that had captured us on our road fromdamascus had it chanced been sent upon duty to a distant part of theempirefrom time to time the prophet visited me and we talked together itold him the history of my life and in his grave and gentle voice heinstructed me in many matters especially in the faith and nature ofthe god he worshipped through his strength he said he interpreteddreams and worked marvels which caused him to be feared of thebabylonians from the days of nebuchadnezzar and although they werejealous of his magic as they held it to be bowed down to by themagicians and interpreters of dreams as one greater than they soearnestly did he instruct me and with such power that at length iwho all my life had searched for a true god and been able to findnone came to accept him of daniel as indeed i think it was in hismind that i should do thus it came about that in the presence ofcertain of the captive israelites i although of another race wasadmitted to the company of the worshippers of jehovah to that faithrejecting all the multitude of the gods of greece and egypt i holdtodayfor the rest thenceforward that holy prophet treated me as one dearto him one to whom he could open some if not all of the doors of hissecret heart he gave me sacred books to read and expounded theirmysteries filled with fire from heaven he repeated prophecieswhether his own or those of other seers i do not know that foretoldthe fall of babylon queen of the worldbehold all this he said pointing to the glittering city that onevery side stretched further than the eye could see to its toweringtemples and its vast encircling walls i say ramose that of it notone brick shall remain upon another it shall be a wilderness whereshepherds feed their flocks by day and the lions prowl at night anabode of death for ever the curse of god hangs over babylononce more i became a recluse as i had been at cyprus more so indeedfor then i heard the voice of the infant myra prattling about thehouse and busied myself with my trade now i studied alone or walkedin the garden where once i had seen myra and been tempted to break myoath thinking and dreaming till had it not been for a certaincomfort which flowed to me from that quiet prophet and from the newfaith he had taught me i believe my heart would have broken even soi grew pale and thin as he noted for often i saw him watching meafter which he would speak hopeful words bidding me to take heartbecause all that is hidden is not lostfrom myra no whisper reached me she had vanished into the secretcourts of the frowning palace of belshazzar where when he was inbabylon he held his orgies and the world saw her no more if theprophet knew aught of her fate he hid it from me from egypt too nonews came though much i wondered what had passed there and what hadchanced to the mother who had treated me so ill and to the plottingpharaoh who had made a tool of me hoping that i should return no moreso except for the rare visits of belus who to me appeared changed andbent down beneath the weight of hidden business of which he would notspeak and for the converse of the prophet who seemed more of an angelthan a man from day to day i dwelt quite alone feeding my heart onhope that grew ever fainter and strengthening my soul as best i mightwith prayer                            chapter xviii                              the letterone night when i sat brooding in my chamber at the guesthouse of theprophet playing with food that i could not eat a servant opened thedoor and through it came belus with much joy i rose to greet him whomi had not seen for many days for always i longed for his company inmy loneliness but without taking the hand i offered him he sank upona couch sayingif you have wine give it mei filled him a cup unmixed with water he swallowed it and asked formore which he drank also as he did so his dark cloak fell open and isaw that beneath it his tunic was stained with blood and that a shortsword thrust through his girdle for its scabbard seemed to have beenlost was likewise still wet with bloodwhence do you come i askedout of the jaws of death he answered certain of my friends and iwere supping together when the door burst opendoubtless it was sometraitors workand a number of soldiers rushed into the room anofficer summoned us to surrender in the name of belshazzar the kingcalling out the names of most there present and mine among themwould you work sacrilege against the gods and their priests criedone of us for we were supping in chamber of the temple where none butthe ordained might enterthe king of the god of gods obey the king or die shouted theofficerhe spoke no more for a man of our company i know not who hurled aknife or a sword with such strength and so true an aim that itpierced that captain from breast to back and he fell down dead thenbegan the fight we were well armed and wore corselets beneath ourrobes for we knew that we went in peril also we were desperate whodid not desire to die by tormentwe cast the flagons and the stools in their faces aye and theburning lamps we leapt upon them like lions we slew them though ofus too some were slain we hurled them living or dead from thewindowplaces to fall a hundred cubits and be crushed at the foot ofthe temple towers to make food for jackals then we scattered and fledand here i am bloody but unhurtand what now belus i asked do you seek sanctuary with theprophetnay i seek horses and men to ride with me also a bag of gold formy lodgings will be watched and i dare not return to themthese you can have belus for they are here but whither go youback towards egyptnot so i go here he bent forward and whispered in my eari goto cyrus the persian who advances upon babylon the accursed i go totell him that her gates will open to him and that if he will but purgeher of her rulers and punish their iniquities the millions of thepeople will welcome him do not stare ramose what i say is true notin vain have i worked for all these moons to fulfil the decrees of godupon belshazzar the murderer and his evil counsellorsoh that i might go with you i saidnay you must bide here where none knows what may happen they saythat zippar is about to fall but i hear also that belshazzar purposesto desert his army and slipping away like a snake to return tobabylon which he believes impregnable hoping for help from egypt andthinking that before its walls cyrus and his persians will certainlybe destroyed therefore if belshazzar comes to babylon you must behere for then who knows what will chance to myra who is captive inhis palacewho knows indeed i moaned and alas how can i help heri cannot say but doubtless there is a road i read of it in thestars though god alone can point it out now i go to speak with theprophet do you bid them make the horses readyfour horses and threemenhow will you pass the gates i askedthe gates of babylon are open to me he said darkly and glided fromthe roombelus went out of my sight and knowledge day followed day moonswaxed and waned and i heard no more of him nor whether he were deador living or had fled to some other land now i was quite alone andsave my servants and sometimes the prophet i saw no man of him iasked what had become of belus and if he had heard aught of the frayin the temple of which i have spoken he answered that he did not knowwhere belus was but he believed him to be still alive for he thoughtthat if he were dead some voice which have told him so in his sleep asaying which comforted me who knew that this prophet was not as areother men but one who communed with heaven and to whom from time totime heaven gave tidingsas regards the fray in the temple he went on i have naught tosay if i know anything to all tales of conspiracies i shut my earswhy should i heed them men think that they do this or that but it isgod who works through them therefore i await the decrees of god andwatch for the falling of his sword what he reveals to me i know toall else my ears are shuti bowed my head being sure that to dispute with him was useless assoon would i have attempted to reason with a spirit then i inquiredof him whether i might now go abroad seeing that all must haveforgotten mehe answered somewhat sternlydid i not tell you ramose that here and nowhere else you are safehere then bide and be patientso i obeyed him only i did this knowing that if it were not lawfulhe would forbid me finding that a steep and narrow stair led to theroof of the tall house i went up it and often sat there crouchingbehind the parapet in the daytime and leaning over it at night when icould not be seen from below this house stood very high being builtupon a mound where once perhaps was a palace or a temple now longfallen except for some walls of which i have written therefore fromits roof i could see much of babylon its great buildings its openplaces its gardens its soaring towers its embracing walls nimittibel the outer wall like to which there is no other in the world andinguebel the inner wall both of them held to be impregnable itscitadel rising from an enormous platform of dried bricks between thetwo its temples of enurta marduk and ishtar with its lovely gateits thousand streets where all day multitudes moved up and down thegreat river euphrates to the west and among its many royal dwellingsthe vast palace of nebuchadnezzar where belshazzar had made his homeit was on this palace that always i fixed my eyes for i knew that upits steps guarded by statues of gods and demons myra had been borneand that somewhere in its courts she dwelt lonelier and perchancemore afraid if that were possible than even i her husband night bynight i would watch the cressets flaring upon its walls wonderingwhat passed there and throwing out my heart to the captive whom theyhid but alas no answer came had she been in egypt had she been inhades she could not have seemed further from me or more lostin the daytime too i stared at the streets and places where peoplegathered and noted or so i thought a change in the demeanour ofthese people they seemed more hurried than they were wont to be theystopped and spoke to each other head close to head like folk whotell each other tidings that must not be overheard or they gatheredinto knots and crowds in the squares and open places and wereaddressed by officers then troops would come and disperse them andthey fled sullenly sometimes leaving certain of their number on theground dead or wounded whom slaves or watchmen bore away onstretchers certainly all was not well in babylonamong the servants who were left to me after the departure of beluswas a man called obil an israelite by descent though a citizen ofbabylon a quiet man who seldom spoke unless he was spoken to but oneto whom i took a liking and learned to trust as indeed the prophethad told me i might do for he was of his faith that had become minealso this obil often went abroad in babylon especially at night andhaving friends there gathered much tidingswhen i discovered this i began to speak with him apart and learnedmany things he told me that great fear had come upon babylon partlybecause of the war with persia which it was rumoured went very illand partly because of the dark sayings of the magicians andastrologers who prophesied evil at handmuch evil and the wrath ofgod about to fall upon the ancient citylistening to these tales i wondered to myself whether belus had beenone of the astrologers who spread abroad this prophecy then i askedwhat of belshazzar and whether the people loved him as they didnabonidus the peaceful although him the priests did not love becausehe meddled with their godsof belshazzar master said obil the news is that he is still withthe army at zippar yet not so closely invested by the persians thathe cannot send messages daily sometimes by word of mouth andsometimes in writing to his officers in babylon yes even aboutsmall matters he added with meaning i know it for the sister ofone of the messengers is a friend of minewhat kind of small matters i asked as carelessly as i couldwell for example master such as that which has to do with the ladywho came from egypt to be of the late kings household and whoafterwards was sent to the prophets house by the royal command thesame with whom we were to travel when the gates were shut upon us onthat night of storm and there was fighting in the gatewaynow my blood ran cold but turning my head to hide my face i askedagainand why does belshazzar send messages about this lady obil did yourfriends sister tell you thatyes master she did and the reason is very strange though i who inmy time have served in the households of the great lords of the earthand watched their ways know that it is true kings and princes andothers of their kind master have everything at their command powerwhich some desire wealth which most desire and especially women whomall desire if they be really men therefore having all they becomesated like gorged brutes and of the fair women that are offered tothem continually few catch their fancy now and again however theysee one for whom they would give half their kingdom especially if itbe not lawful that they should take her or if they know that for thisreason or for that she turns from themsuch it seems is what has happened in the case of belshazzar and thelady from egypt who is named myra he saw her at the court when oldnabonidus the late king being moved by her wondrous beautydescended from his throne and publicly received her to himself thatwas before this lady told nabonidus as i heard with my own ears beingthen a servant of the court that she was no princess of egypt alsothat she was already married to a man from whom she had been stolenperhaps you have been told the story masteryes obil and i have learned that thereon nabonidus committed her tothe charge of our great prophet whose sanctuary none dares to violateand we know the restthat is so still part of this story may be new to you if myfriends sister tells it truly not even belshazzar dares to violatethe sanctuary of the holy prophet of israel whom he fears above anyman that lives because like nebuchadnezzar before him he believeshim to be almost a god yet he caused it to be watched by many spiesand gave strict command to his officers for which they must answerwith their lives that if the lady came out of that sanctuary even byorder of the king his father she should be seized and carried to hispalace there to be given to him when he returns this master as youknow was doneis this all that your friends sister told you obilno master it appears that belshazzar who now is king has beensmitten with a madness concerning this fair woman so that he thinksmore of her than he does of the war with the persians or any othermatter which madness has increased greatly since a rumour has reachedhim that the man to whom she was married is not in egypt but hiddenin babylon this is his desireto find that man and cause him to betormented to death before her very eyes and while he lies dying toappear and drag her away for such master are the royal pleasures ofgreat kingsdoes he know this mans name obilaccording to my friends sister who seems to hear all secrets he isnot sure of the name but he believes the man to be belus also knownas azar an enemy of his own to whom he worked some injury in thepast and by birth a great lord of babylon he who appeared beforenabonidus and told a tale as to this lady being wed to a noble ofegypt at the last although he is not sure whether he be the man heseeks everywhere for belus that he may capture him and put him to thequestion or failing that kill him outrightas nearly chanced the other day i saidyes master but belus escaped him and now has left babylon with someof our people upon a mission of his ownwhy did you not go with him seeing that it was belus who hired youand not i i asked sharplyperhaps because i was otherwise commanded or because i thought imight be of more service elsewhere he replied bowing his headi thought a moment then i turned and spoke words that seemed to beput into my mindobil i said you know more than you pretend you know that i amthe husband of the lady myra not belus and all my caseyes master i know these things for i have been told them under anoath that may not be broken if i would avoid death in this world andsave my soul in any that is to come we worship the same god andtherefore he who betrays his brother betrays his godwho told you i askedbelus told me in his youth he was my fathers friend therefore hetrusts me and hired me to go upon that journey which has not beenaccomplished afterwards knowing that he might be called away hetold me all bidding me to serve you and another to the deathnow i bethought me that this obil whom it pleased to play the part ofa servant was more than he seemed and that doubtless he had his sharein the dark conspiracies of belus but of this matter i said nothingdoes the prophet know that you have my secret i askedthe prophet knows all for god tells himi thought a while for good or ill i was in this mans power no matterwhat i did or left undone he had learned my secret from belus oranother and if it pleased him could betray me or leave meunbetrayed my crime was that i had married myra whom the mighty kingof babylon desired and for that if i were caught i must die itcould not be added to by aught that i did or lessened by aught that ileft undone therefore i would be boldcan you help me obilhow masterby causing it to come to the ears of a certain lady that a certainman still waits in babylon hoping for the best and by bringingtidings to me of her under her own hand if may be that i may knowthat they are trueit is dangerous master and yet i have friends in the palace ayeeven among the eunuchs and if you desire it i will try who am biddento serve you in all things yet blame me not if aught goes wrongi shall not blame you i answered andoh no longer can i endurethis silence i must hear i must learn or i think that i shall diei will do what i may said obil and turned to godo so friend and whether you succeed or fail be sure that if everi come safe out of this accursed city i will make you rich meanwhiletake what gold you want you know where it isi thank you master who desire to rest in some far land atjerusalem if it may be and whose substance has been stolen bybabylonians because i am of a race they hatethen he wentfour nights later obil appeared as i finished my evening meal andslipped a clay tablet into my hand i glanced at it who could read thebabylonian writing as well as i could the egyptian or the greek andsaw at once that it was but an ancient table of accounts sealed bysome priest a note indeed of the delivery of a number of measures ofcorn into the storehouse of a certain templewhat jest is this i askedlet the master press the tablet between his finger and his thumb andhe may learn answered obil in a dry voicei did so and it flew to pieces being in truth but a hollow cylinderof clay that had been broken and cunningly joined together with aninvisible cement within was a tightly rolled papyrus covered withtiny writing in the grecian character at the sight of which my heartstood stillthere is your letter master said obil which i came by at greatrisk how is best left unsaid and at the cost of all the gold yougave me aye and more of my ownrecompense yourself with as much as you will i will thank you laterfriend i answered hurriedly who burned to study the letterhe went and standing under the hanging lamp i undid the roll on itwere written these words o most beloved the message has reached me it matters not how and i rejoice  yea i thank god for thereby i learn that you are safe and well  know beloved that i feared aye and had it not been for my  faith in god and my memory of a certain prophecy made by a true  seer far away i should have believed that you were dead  immediately after that kiss in the archway which in dreams still  burns my lips i thought that i saw you fall pierced by a sword  now i know that it was another man and that the gloom or the  dazzle of the lightning deceived me i was dragged away i am a  prisoneryou will know wherean appointed prey to a certain  great one when he returns for in an accursed hourmay it be  blotted out of the book of timehe looked upon me unveiled and  found me to his fancy indeed it seems that although absent he  remembers me and rejoices that i am taken as he planned that i  should be he has even written to me vile things to which his  servants force me to listen dragging away my hands when i would  stop my ears all his fair women whom i hate praise my beauty  they scent me they comb my hair with golden combs they paint my  eyes and lips feeding me with sweetmeats and if i struggle they  laugh naming me a cat of egypt and calling to the eunuchs to come  to hold me while they appraise me inch by inch all these and  other things i suffer because i hope that god will be good to us  and bring us together again how i know not who am a bird in a  golden cage learn this my hearts desire that the worst shall  never fall upon me for when all hope is gone i will die as i  have the means to do never shall that royal brute so much as  defile me with his finger tip i dare write no more for i think  that i am watched here the very walls have eyes and ears beloved  husband i trust in god do thou the same for he is just aye  even if he does not help us here yet i am persuaded that he is  just and good and in some other land far from babylon and the  cruel earth he will unite us for ever yes when babylon is dust  and quite forgotten that lips to lips and heart to heart we shall  look down upon the sands that shroud its palaces and the bones of  its accursed kingssuch was the letter that was unsigned indeed from the writing ijudged that for some reason or other it was never finished still itwas hers this i knew from some of the greek phrases more ancient andpurer than was the common use of a style indeed that i who was halfa greek myself had taught to myra also those high thoughts and thatvision of peace beyond the earth and every joy for those who hadsuffered on the earth were all her own indeed once when fears of thefuture took her she had spoken to me in like wordsoh the letter was myras her hand had pressed it her breath hadbreathed upon it her eyes perhaps had wept upon it as certain marksseemed to show and therefore to me it was a thing more precious thanall the treasure of the world and yet how dreadful was the tale ittold myra a prisoner pampered petted fattened scented that shemight be made more acceptable to the jaded appetite of this filthyking this royal ravisher who preyed on women as a rat preys uponcooped birds seizing them sucking their blood casting them aside todie and rushing at another my soul sickened at the thought my bloodran cold when i pictured her my own my peculiar treasure my lovewhom i had always loved from her childhood and yet for long had neverquite known that i loved in that full fashion helpless in the handsof this crowned brutewhat a fool and madman had i been why had i not married her whenfirst she came to womanhood then before ever these kings set theirleering eyes upon her beauty she would have been the mother ofchildren and therefore one whom they did not desire then we shouldhave passed our lives together in peace but i thought to give herliberty to let her choose some younger man if so she willed notguessing that with body and with soul from the hour that she knew iwas not her father she had turned to me and me alone thereforebecause of my mothers pride and common vanity all these evils hadcome upon us and what was done could not be undone myra lay in hergorgeous den panting and beating its bars of gold whilst she waitedthe coming of the wolf that would tear her for his pleasure and ifar away and powerless could stretch out no hand to save heralthough her cry echoed in my earsshe said that first she would die and doubtless it was so unless intheir cunning way they robbed her of the means of death well if shedied surely i should know it surely her spirit would touch me in itspassing so that i might make haste to follow yet what an end onethat was forbid also by the law which said that all torments must beendured for the pleasure of the gods yet if need were it should befacedi lifted the letter to my lips and kissed it then i pressed it to myheart and wept yes i a man of full age and a captain of men weptlike a girli felt a hand upon my shoulder and looked up by me stood the prophetthe holy one of the people of judahwhy do you weep ramose he asked gentlyi told him all and even gave him the letter to read though in truthhe scarcely looked at it but set it down as though already he knewwhat was written thereyou have done foolishly and for the second time ramose he saidyou who lack faith and patience have i not told you to wait and becontent and now who knows it is not easy for women of the kingshousehold to send out letters unobserved and if this one has beenseen what then well it is too late to question let the matter beyet i pray you to promise me that you will send no more such messagesand seek no more letters from a certain lady who lies hid in yonderpalacei ask pardon and i promise i answered humbly be not wrath withme o prophet i feared lest she were dead as you see she feared thati was dead and the temptation was too greathad she been dead i should have told you ramose do you think thatfor no purpose i desire to keep you here in babylon where you go ingreat peril day by day if she were dead or lost to you beyond allhope long ago i should have sent you hence for the last time i saybe warned and unless i bid you do nothing in this matter save bidehere and waitthus he spoke more sternly than he had ever done to me and seekingno answer departed leaving me afraid what did he mean when he spokeof my going in danger day by day i thought that here in his house ilay hid and safe from every peril also that none knew that theegyptian ramose was in babylon or even that a certain ptahmes dwelton there yet if these things were not known why did i go in dangeri say that i grew afraid not for myself who have never been a cowardbut for myra if evil overtook me what would chance to myra who thensave for belus if he still lived would be alone in the worldoh i was afraid of this prophet about whom there was somethingunearthly and even terrible he seemed to walk the earth like aspirit or a god knowing all perchance directing all yet holding hislips sealed and hiding his countenance and he was wrath with mebecause i did not trust to him more utterly forgetting that it ishard for men who are sinners to put all their faith and hopes in thehands of saints and prophets seeing that to their knowledge suchoften deceive themselves and lead others to their ruinin what troubles was i snared and wrapped like a gnat in a spidersweb when the royal atyra was murdered because of me i had sworn thatnever again would i look in love on woman and holding down the fleshfor many years i had kept that oath and been happy then myra thesnowmaiden of a sudden turned to flame and set me afire also sothat we burned upon one pyre which was like to be such as the oldgreeks used to consume the dead well for me and well for her if wehad gone different ways and our lips had never met in lovenay it was not so for even if we died separate or together stillour lips had met still that holy fire had been lit which must burneternally oh better to suffer and to love than to live out fatunanxious years in such peace as oxen know for then what harvest canthe spirit hope to bear with it from the earth to sow again beyond theearth                             chapter xix                        the lady of the litterthe weary days went on as i had promised i attempted to send no moremessages and indeed told obil that i sought no further letters forthese were too dangerous this saying i noted seemed to please himwho although he made no complaint and expressed no fear to me nowalways appeared to walk like one who is straining his ears to listenwhile continually he glances over his shoulder to see if he isfollowedhad obil some secret cause for dread i wondered uneasily and if sowas i to blame this doubt took a hold of me so that more than oncealmost i spoke to him on the matter purposing to ask him whether hewould not do well to leave my service and hide himself yet in the endi did not who in the words of the egyptian proverb though it wisernot to kick the sleeping jackal lest it should yap and call the lionalso i believed that the prophet would protect himat last came a day when obil brought some news and it was dreadfulbelshazzar the king had returned to babylon that morning shortly afterdawn obil who had gone early to the market to buy our food saw himcome driving furiously in a chariot and accompanied by other chariotsand horsemen who seemed weary as though they had galloped through thelivelong night i asked him of this king and he answered that helooked fierce yet frightened like to one who had an evil spiritsitting on his shoulder and calling disaster in his ear his eyeflashed his long hair flew out behind him and when an old womancarrying fish in a basket on her back stumbled and fell blocking thenarrow road with a curse he bade the charioteer drive over her thiswas done leaving her crushed and shrieking with blood running fromher a sight that angered the people for they muttered and some shooktheir fists after the king yet none of them dared to touch the womanwhom he had chosen to destroy and who lay there till she diedit seems that the people of babylon do not love this king of theirsi saidno master they hate him who is the most cruel of whom historytells yet they fear him for he never forgets and his vengeance isvery terrible while nabonidus lived they could appeal to himsometimes but now that he is dead they can only appeal to their godswho do not listenwhat news of the persian war i asked himnone that is certain indeed few talk of it because it is forbiddenbut those who do shake their heads and mutter of defeat and capturedcities they say too that belshazzar has escaped from zippar or someother beleaguered place and fled to babylon because he believes itimpregnable and hopes to hold it until he can win succour from othercountries it is even reported that an embassy has come from egypt totreat with him on this matter for so hardly is he pressed that he hasoffered to pharaoh lordship over all the syrian lands that babylonstill holds and a great sum in gold if only he will send an army tohis succournow when i heard this i marvelled only a little while ago naboniduswas quarrelling with pharaoh over the matter of myra and thatbelshazzar should now be imploring help from him showed me that hemust indeed be pressed still i said no more thinking to myself thati would ask the prophet of the truth of this story but when iinquired whether he would be pleased to see me i received a messagewhich he had left for me saying that he had gone to some hidden placeto pray and would not return till after sunset or perhaps not untilthe morrowso i sat alone in my chamber consumed with such fears as may not bewritten for were not myra and belshazzar the king now beneath thesame roof aye was she not as a bird in the very hand of the snarerlater in the day i sent again for obil thinking that i might gathermore tidings but a servant called nabel came in his stead muchdisturbed he said that he and obil had been walking in the streetwhen suddenly guards pounced on them seized obil and dragged himaway thereon he fled fearing lest they should take him also whichthey made no attempt to dowhere then is obil i askedwhere the lamb is after it wandered and met the eagle masteranswered the man grimly for those guards bore the royal badgethe motherless lamb is good to the eagle but what is obil to acertain bird that has a beak but no wings i askeddoubtless food also of one sort or another or may be his entrailswill furnish auguries he answered in a cold voice that frightenedmefor now i was sure that obil had been seized because he had to do witha certain message and a certain letter and could say who sent themessage and who received the letter still all was well obil was anupright man like myself a worshipper of jehovah who would break nooathsthen i remembered that tyrants and kings have dreadful ways ofdragging out the truth from the most secret soul and shiveredlater in that terrible day between two and three hours before sunsetthis same man nabel entered the chamber where i sat brooding bearinga covered basket of woven rusheswhat is this i askeda lovegift as i think master at least the women of babylon whenthey are smitten with desire for some man who has caught their eyeare wont to send such baskets adorned like this with the rich coloursof lovethen it cannot be for me upon whose countenance no lady has lookedfor months i answered smilingyet it is always well to learn what is hidden in any covered basketsaid nabel meaninglythereon i undid the silken string and threw back the lid revealingripe figs each of them wrapped in a vine leaftake out the figsbut do not eat them said nabel and i did solifting the purple fruit one by one and setting them on the tableat length i came to a package wrapped in linen i undid this packageand behold there appeared just such a clay cylinder as that which hadcovered myras letter i took it i pressed it fell to pieces andwithin was a little papyrus roll inscribed with tiny writing in thegrecian charactereagerly i read it ran thus beloved i am in a sore straight but i have found a certain road of escape  for both of us what it is i dare not write there is a feast  tonight in the great hall of the palace which feast you must  attend array yourself in a dress of honour and come hither guided  by one whom i send who is a friend to me i dare write no more  but all will be made clear at the time appointed oh fail me not  if ever you would clasp me in your arms and look again upon a  happy house fail me not now cast aside all doubts and fear be  bold and come lest we be parted for ever choose then between joy  and death for learn beloved that if you come not this very day  i must die to save myself from a more evil fatetwice i read this letter through from the first word to the last theni laid it down and thought as perhaps i had never done beforeswiftly fiercely i weighed and pondered all taking the first letterfrom where it was hidden i compared the two the encasing tabletswere of the same sort though the writing on them was different forthis second tablet purported to deal with the sale of a field in thereign of some earlier babylonian king reserving the trees in thefield to the seller and his heirs as is often done in the eastmoreover the broken fragments of the tablet had been joined togetherwith the same sort of invisible cement the papyrus on which bothletters were written also seemed to be the same of an egyptian makeas i who had used so much of it knew well and scented with a likescent in the greek character further i could find no differencethough the ink of the second letter varied a little in colour from thefirst being darker in huestill seeing that grecian characters written by a good scribe arehard to know apart i could not be sure that this greek was written bymyra though as in the case of the first letter from its style ibelieved it to be hers lastly in both letters the writer spoke ofending her life rather than suffer shame and in the second she calledour house at memphis by its name which surely no one else would knowoh i could not doubt myra had penned this second letter as she hadpenned the firstthen why did i not prepare to do her bidding putting aside all doubtsand fears as she bade me for one reason onlybecause of my promiseto the prophet yet what was that promise that i should attempt nomore to send her messages and draw answers from her one that i hadkept to the full for the rest he had only bidden me to bide here inthis house but if he saw that letter doubtless he would recall hiswords alas that i could not show it to him alas that now when ineeded him so sorely he was far away where i knew notso it stood thus on the one hand was myras letter which if obeyedmeant escape and joy and if not obeyed meant her death that mustsoon be followed by my own on the other the bidding of the prophetthat i should not leave his house because if i did so i might comeinto peril but could i hesitate for such a reason when myra stood inperils a hundred times as great i could not i would put on the robeof honour that nabonidus had given me to wear when i walked from myapartments to the royal presence and go yet how was i to goshe spoke of one whom she sent to guide me who was a friend to herwhere then was this guide i called the man nabel who had brought methe basket and inquired how it had come into his hands he answeredthat an old beggarwoman had given it to him as he stood in the streetoutside the door and that she was now crouched in the shadow of abroken wall near by as he thought asleep i asked him if she had saidanythingyes master he replied she said that she was commanded to leadthe lord to whom the basket must be delivered to where he would goand that she would wait until he was ready which he must be bysunseti glanced at the sky and saw that there was yet an hour before the sunvanished this was well for in an hour much might happen the prophetmight return the old woman might depart in which case i could notaccompany her and the problem would solve itself meanwhile i wouldmake readyi washed myself i trimmed my long hair and the square beard that inow wore after the babylonian fashion wondering foolishly whethermyra would prefer it thus or whether she would bid me shape it as ofold when at last we were far away and safe wondering also with whatlooks and words she would greet me and many other such vain things ascome into the minds of lovers then i put on the robe of honour arich garment embroidered with silver and having a deep collar thatcould be turned up to hide the face such a robe as the babylonianswore over their linen dress when they attended feasts or at nightwhen they went where they did not wish to be known for then theyraised this collar till almost it met the headdress of folded silkby the time that all was done the suns red rim made a path of fireover the broad bosom of the euphrates and i knew that very soon itwould be gone i sent once more to learn if the prophet had returnedbut there was no sign of him then torn this way and that by hopes andfears i knelt down and prayed to god to guide me as i knew theprophet was wont to do i was not warned against this enterprise bysign or token or symbol or by the stirring of my heart therefore ifelt encouraged in it who did not understand that already the firstwarning and the last had been given to me through the mouth of thegreat prophet who as always spoke with the voice of godthe sun having vanished i gathered up my courage and called to nabelwho had brought the basket in his charge i left the letter i hadreceived with a message to the prophet should he return saying thati had obeyed what was written in the letter having no choice forotherwise i must have gone mad he learned the message by heart andsaid that it should be delivered with the writing which i knew hecould not read who had no greekthen nabel led me out through the secret door by which first i hadentered this house and along an old broken wall of the buildingwhich was here before it to a niche in the wall where perhaps oncestood the statue of some king or god in this niche wrapped in atattered garment crouched an old woman who seemed to be asleep ifso she slumbered warily for at the sound of our steps she scrambledto her feet hobbled forward and stared at me by such light asremainedla she said so this is he to whom i bore the lovebasket alikely man enough though no youth but there when i was in my flowerand beautiful always i turned to one of middleage perhaps becausebeing no fool myself i sought wisdom as well as kisses come onlover and may the goddess of love who mind you by whatever namethey call her is the greatest in the whole world be your friendtonightthus she babbled on as i guessed to stop my mouth so that i couldnot question her all the while leading me by quick turns from sidestreet to side street till at length we reached a quiet grassgrownplace surrounded by tall houses in whose windows no lamps burnedeither because it was too early for them to be lit or because thehouses were desertedin this place as the faint light showed for that night was one offull moon was a large litter resting on the ground and standing atits poles twelve black men dressed in uniform who neither stirred norspoke ethiopian slaves they seemed to be the old woman led me to thelitter whisperingenter lover nay stop not to fee me who am already well paid andwhose joy it is to bring together those who waste away apart enterand when you are happy remember meso through the curtains which she opened i stumbled into that darklitter to find myself caught in a womans arms and resting on awomans breast i thoughtwho would notthat it must be she isought she of whom my heart was full and no other therefore i threwmy answering arms about her and drawing her to me kissed her on eyesand lips nor did she say me nay at length she laughed a little andthe laugh seemed strange to me then she said in the babylonian tongueand in a voice that though pleasant was stranger stilli have always heard friend that you men of egypt were warmheartedand forward to attack but never till now did i understand howfaithful was the tale kiss on friend if it pleases you for kissesare cheerful and they leave no scarsnow i shrank back gasping and amazed not far it is true for thelitter would not allow of it whereon my companion continued hermockeryare you tired of lovemaking she answered and so soon or do youfear that ishtar has not blessed me it is not so i swear look nowi will draw the curtain a little and you will see that i am wellfavoured enough to please most men even if they be highbornegyptiansthereon she leant forward pressing her face against my own and didso at first i could see nothing both because i could scarcely move myhead and secondly for the reason that the moonlight was cut offeither by a cloud or by some house presently however the litterswung round a corner for all this while we were being carriedforward and for a few moments the light shone on her showing that inher fashion she was very fair roundfaced redlipped and with darkalluring eyes also she was young and most shapelyso she said letting the curtain fall again not so ill am i atany rate in this gloom where one might well pass for another youtoo are better to look at than i thought handsome indeedtherefore and again she pressed herself against melady i murmured i may not i go to meet one to whom i am swornandi may notwell even so there is no reason to tremble like a leaf or as thoughyou found yourself companioned by a snake you would not greet thelady by telling her how you came to her and with whom would you ifishtar keeps her eyes shut need you open hers moreover she addedand now i caught a note of warning in her voice how do you know thatyou will find that lady who perhaps also travels in a litter withanother have you no proverb in egypt friend that says take whatthe gods give while their hands are open for none know what they willwithhold when they are shutoh lady mock me not i am in a sore straitshe laughed a little musically enough and answeredso i can guess indeed i am sure of it and therefore i forgive youwhich being vain i should not do if i thought that you shrank fromme because i was unpleasing to you poor man be at peace see hereis a cushion will you not use it to cover your face the warmestkisses cannot burn it through moreover it was you who began them noti i did but take fire from your torchthen she leant back and continued laughing and there was somethingabout her voice which told me that however bold she might be she wasalso kindheartedwe travelled on in silence for a while then she saidi will tell you something lest you should misjudge me you can guessthat i am girl whose eyes are not always fixed upon the ground but iam nothing worse i was sent to bring you as one from whom a man wouldnot flee as he might do from another man but by marduk i do not knowwhy i am sent who earn my fee and ask no questions believe meegyptian i am not the bait upon any trapwho sent you i askeda eunuch as usual where such palace errands are concerned andtherefore i smell a love affairis it so i thought perhaps that it was a ladywithout doubt for there is always a lady behind the eunuch sheanswered in the voice of one who wished to leave this matterundiscussedthen i remembered the words of myras letter that she was sending onewho was a friend of hers to lead me to her and marvelled a littlefor this fair wanton seemed a strange friend for myra to have chosenonly i remembered also that she was dwelling in a court and it wasprobable could not choose her friends but must take any that wouldserve her turn a dangerous one enough therefore i let that doubttrouble my mind no more presently the litter halted for a moment anda challenge was given which was answered by one of the bearers inwords that i could not catch thereon he who had challenged laughedand we went forward again from which i guessed that we had passedsome gate the lady leant forward and whispered in a new voicefriend we have passed the outer wall of the palace and are about togo down intohell for the palace of belshazzar is hell indeed as iknow who dwell there with others of my kind you are bold who beingfree enter such a place where from hour to hour none knows what maychance to him but doubtless you have your reasons which it does notbecome me to ask now i am going to make a request to you to grant orto refuse as you will it is that you will kiss me once more upon thebrow this time not as a lover but as a brother might and tell methat you forgive me my mockeries for i would fain be kissed once byan honest man as i feel you to benow i thought a moment i did not wish to touch this woman again yetsome voice speaking in my heart urged me to do as she desired so ilistened to that voice and kissed her for which she thanked me veryhumbly as the end will show well was it for me that i did so therebymaking her my friendagain we were challenged and this time the word of the bearers was notacceptedlean back said my companionthen she opened the curtains a little and spoke between them at thesame time thrusting out her hand on which there was some ringgo on cried a voice it is only adna with one of her gallants whocarries warrant on her finger to pass where she will with whom shewill on this night of festival when ishtar reigns say adna may inot share that litter with you three nights hence when my leavebeginsaye she answered mockingly if between now and then you willchange yourself from a vulgar fellow into a gentleman of breeding whocan tell the name of his grandfather which is impossible a bittersaying that caused the officers companions to laughwe went on again through sundry courts as i gathered by the cuttingoff of the moonlight and at length halted in some silent placeadna as i had now learned the woman with me was called sprang fromthe litter that had been set down upon the ground and running up somesteps to a little door tapped upon it three times and after a pausetwice more quickly the door opened and for a while she talked withsome one in a whisper after which she returned to the litter andsaidmy task is done yours whatever it may be begins descendnow some cold hand of fear seemed to grip my heart some sense thatthis place was unfriendly and dangerous to me so that of all thingsin the world that which i wished the least was to enter there a sweatburst out upon my brow i became a coward eaten up of doubtscan you not take me back by the road we came lady i askednay she answered you have entered by your own will and here youmust stay as the fishgod said to the eel in the trap when it learnedthat it was about to be skinned alive oh why will men run so fast tocatch women who are not worth it after all goodbye and may all thegods of all the lands befriend you just for the sake of that onehonest kissthen servants four of them all armed appeared and handed me from thelitter bowing as though to a great lord at the head of the steps iglanced back and saw the light of the torch they bore shining on thebeautiful face of the whiterobed adna as she stood by the litterwatching me depart moreover unless some trick of the shadowsdeceived me i could have sworn that tears were running down thatfacewhy and for whom did adna shed those tears i wondered                              chapter xx                           the end of obilthe little door clanged to behind me and with a fluttering of my hearti heard the bronze bolts rattle as they went home in their marblesockets then i was led down narrow passages many of them that turnedand forked and turned again till i lost all count of how they ran atlength i reached cedar doors before which stood guards the doorsopened and out came other servants who took me from those by whom ihad been brought thus far and led me into a lofty room that wasseparated from an inner chamber by broidered curtainshere i stood for a space while passing between the curtains one ofthe servants made some report that seemed to cause a man within tolaugh loudly then he returned and i was led or rather pushed throughthe curtains on the farther side of which i halted bewildered beingdazzled by the multitude and brightness of the lights a voice said inmy eardown be prostrate before the king of kings but still i stoodbewildered seeing no kingwhen presently my eyes grew accustomed to the blaze of light iperceived that i was in a large chamber cedarroofed and adorned withgoldworked hangings at the end of this chamber seated in a gildedand jewelled chair was a large hooknosed bearded man withunwinking eyes that reminded me of those of a vulture whom i knew tobe belshazzar the kinghe stared at me with those bold fixed eyes then said in a voice assoft as though his throat had been soaked in oillet him alone these barbarian foreign lords do not understand thecustoms of our court if he does not prostrate himself of his owncourtesy i saylet him alone who may ere long learn to mend hismanners bring him here i would speak with himso i was led forward and stood before the kinghow are you named he asked eyeing me up and down with his vulturestarei am called ptahmes o king i answered who did not dare to give myown name and i noted that a scribe who stood by wrote down thewordsis it so i think that i have heard otherwise what are you doing inbabylon and what are youi am a man of learning o king of whom the late king your fatherwas pleased to make a friend when we discussed the attributes of thegods he gave me this robe in which i standdid he then a fool made presents to a knave he replied coarselyand the courtiers laughed where are you living he went oni am the guest of the prophet belteshazzar o king he whom the lateking nebuchadnezzar made governor of babylonindeed then as i suspected that old hebrew dreamdoctor keeps badcompany by marduk he shall answer for it to me who do not fear hisspells as did nebuchadnezzar the madman are you also one of the menof judahi am a worshipper of the god of judah o kingand therefore an enemy of the gods of babylon well let the godsfight their own battles i mock them all who have served me ill oflate and chiefly this cheat of judah whose temple we have plunderedand whose golden vessels are my washpots he has cursed me so sayhis priests but as he has no statue to be defiled i spit upon hisname and will show him that the king of babylon is greater than theheavenly cheat of judah as did the kings who went before me what sayyou mannow when i heard these blasphemies i shivered nor as i think werethey pleasing to the ears of the courtiers for i saw some of themturn their heads and make the sign that babylonians use to avert evilis it for me to reason with the king or to revile him whom iworship as the king said let the gods fight their own battles whichdoubtless they will do i answered slowlyso in veiled words you threaten me with this god of yours do youyet i think that before long you will revile his name and loudly inall our ears how came you here and for what purpose o ptahmesa woman brought me o kingher namei am not sure of it but one of the guards called her adnaall those present smiled and belshazzar answered with a brutal laughoh adna we all know the beautiful adna did you then propose to usemy palace as a house of ill famenot so o king i was told that i was among those bidden to a feastbecause the late king nabonidus had favoured mewere you then learn that i do not pick my feasters from among myfathers toadies tricked out in his old clothes and he pointed to mycloak which i now noticed was of a different make and stuff from thoseworn by the officers around himi was silent not knowing what to say for a while he sat staring atme his face alive with hate as though i were his bitterest foe thenhe spoke again changing his soft voice as he had the power to dofor one like to the roar of a lionlet us have done with all these lies he said for i weary of theplay and time grows short captain bring in the man obil that we mayrefresh ourselves with a breath of truthnow the officer addressed hesitated seeing which the king struck thearm of the chair with his sceptre and shouted againdo you not hear me bring in the spy obilso sharply did he strike that the ivory sceptre snapped in two and thegolden head in which was set a great emerald rolled along the floortill it lay still between my feet a gasp of fear at this most evilomen rose from those who saw it and even the kings wineflushed facepaled for a moment recovering himself he turned on them snarling andaskedare you afraid do you think that the cheat jehovah answers me by asign worked upon this rod of power that all the gods of babylon haveblessed i tell you that with half a sceptre i will hunt him out ofheaven yes and shatter cyrus whom the men of judah call his swordaye i will thrust it down the persians throat and watch it chokehimmay the king live for ever said the courtiers bowing the king isgreater than all the conquered gods of all the peoplesi saw i heard and for the first time some comfort crept into myscared soul as i set my foot upon that sceptrehead beneath the hem ofmy robe where it lay hidden and spurned it for well i knew that thisbeast king was but as dust before the breath of jehovah the holy oneof judah then i stepped back and showed the great jewel flashing onthe ground like to a tigers evil eyea door at the side of the chamber was opened and through it came fourbloodstained black men naked save for loin cloths who bore astretcher covered with a clothmay it please the king obil is here as the king commanded said thecaptainat a sign from the king he threw back the cloth revealing a hideoussight from which even those cruel babylonians shrank back for therelay obil mutilated torn to pieces scarred with fire and bathed inblood more i will not write it is enoughbid the dog speak if he would not taste of a worse torment and tellme what he knows of this man who bribed him to corrupt my servants andcarry letters from a lady of my household said belshazzarmay it please the king said the captain in a trembling voice obilcannot speak he is deaddead roared belshazzar how comes it that he is dead when icommanded that he should be kept alive and he glared at the blackslaves who shook in their terrormay it please the king went on the captain the scribe here whoseoffice it is to be present at tormentings and take down the wordsuttered by the victimsi mean by the wicked sentenced to punishmentsays that this obstinate man of judah obil snatched a heated knifefrom the hand of one of the slaves and drove it into his own heartsee it stands there in his breastand what said the fellow before he died asked belshazzar of thescribe who answeredmay it please the king he said nothing save that he believed thisman here was an egyptian of royal blood and that the king could neverharm him as he was protected by the spirit of belteshazzar the greatprophet of judah naught else could be wrung from him by any tormentthat is known indeed with his last words he denied all the little hehad uttereddid he tell you naught of belus or azar my enemy in whose pay hewas and whither he has gonenaught o kingtake that carrion away and let those clumsy slaves await mypunishment under guard for i think that presently they shall taste oftheir own medicine said the king glaring again at the black menso the body of the steadfast obil was carried off and as it went iprostrated my heart before him whom unwittingly i had brought todeath and blessed his spirit praying its pardon and that of godwhen it was gone and slaves had scattered perfume over the spot wherethe tormentors and the litter had stood the king spoke again sayingwe have learned little of this man from that dead hebrew save thathe is an egyptian of royal blood and even this he denied again beforehis end nor is it of any use to ask the fellow himself except undertorment for doubtless he will lie as all egyptians do yet if as isreported he be really of the blood of amasis we must go softly forat this moment babylon does not wish to make a foe of pharaoh now ihave heard rumours concerning the man and i would put them to theproof as happily i have the means to do what say you mycounsellorsthe king is wise may the king live for ever answered thesereptiles bowing like snakes before the rod of their charmerthen belshazzar turned to a chamberlain who stood upon his right witha wand in his hand and saidadmit those ladies who await an audience of my majesty and be silenteveryone while i talk with them remember all also you egyptianthat whoever speaks before i open his mouth dies and without movinghis head he turned his flashing eyes towards the door through whichthe torturers had departed with their horrible burden then fixed themthreateningly upon mepresently the curtains that hung over another of the entrances to thatgreat chamber were drawn and from between them appeared two ladiesdraped in long veils of whom because of these veils little could beseen except that they were tall and walked gracefully after themcame other women whom i took to be attendants because their heads werebowed also i noted that the pair who came first seemed to bestrangers or enemies for they exchanged no word and edged away fromeach other having made their obeisance to the king they were haltedby the chamberlain at a little distance from where i stood then theylooked at me and i perceived that both of them began to sway andtremble like papyrus reeds beneath the weight of a breath of windseeing which i grew suddenly afraid indeed from the moment that theyentered i had been afraid because there was something which came fromthem to me that stirred my spirit and awoke memories of i knew notwhatbe pleased ladies as this is no public court to put off ceremonyand to unveil yourselves said belshazzar in his softest voicethereon the waiting women sprang forward and loosed the wrappings fromthe heads of the two ladies whom i watched intently wondering whetheri should know themthe veils fell and were snatched away and next moment i too nearlyfell down for before me stood myra and my mother both of them werewonderfully arrayed and as a man sees in a dream i noted that on mymothers head was a royal ornament at least from it fashioned ingems rose something that resembled the uraeus snake of egypt thatonly might be worn by kings their spouses and their children of thetrue bloodmyra bent forward as though to speak but in a stern voice belshazzarbade her to be silent then addressing my mother he saidroyal lady for so from our brother pharaohs letters i understandyou are who for your own reasons have been pleased to favour me byaccompanying egypts embassy to babylon as if you were so minded iprayed that you would do tell me i pray whether you know this manwho stands before me and if so who and what he isthese words the king spoke in his own language but an interpreter whomust have been waiting there for the purpose rendered them in greekknow him she answered with a cry using that same tongue forindeed she had never learned any other very well can a mother forgetthe child she bore great king he is my own and only son begotten bythe good god pharaoh apries when i was his wife yes my son of theroyal blood a count of egypt and a governor of memphis whom havinglost by pharaohs leave i have travelled so far to seek as youinvited me to do through your envoy o king of kings amasis thepresent divine pharaoh sent him as an ambassador to cyrus thepersian after which he vanished o king wherefore hearing from yourenvoy that he was rumoured to be still in babylon hidden away i cameto seek him andam hereis he named ptahmes ladynay o king his name is ramose she exclaimed astonishedi thank you lady for this makes certain what we had heardelsewhere that ptahmes is a false name under which it has pleased thenoble but modest ramose to hide himself in babylon now royal chloeas i believe that you are called be pleased to tell me whether youknow the lady who stands near to youyes o king though i have not seen her since she left egypt to bewed to the king nabonidus a marriage i am told that did not takeplace because of some falsehood that was published concerning heralthough now she is to become your queen o king a glorious destinyindeed yes the wife of the greatest monarch in all the world andshe lifted her eyes as though in adoration of a godyou are right lady and it is for this reason that we havepetitioned of you to honour us with your presence here in babylon ifonly for a while that we may bestow upon you such gifts and titles asbecome one who is said to be the grandmother of a lady whom its kingtakes as wife we beg you therefore to tell us here and now whetherthis is so as in his letters amasis the pharaoh of egypt declaresbecause if i may say it in your person you are still so young andbeautiful that doubts have arisen as to this matternow i fell into an agony or rather into a deeper agony who knew notwhat words would come from the mouth of this foolish mother of mine inthe madness of her vanity i who remembering belshazzars terriblethreat dared not speak fixed my eyes upon her face as i saw myradid also striving to send a message from my heart to hers warningher of my peril but she took no heed indeed she only blushed andbowed then answered in a pleased voiceo king my son ramose was born when i was still very young nor is hehimself so far advanced in years as might be thought from his facethat has grown lined with study of deep things i do not understandnow belshazzar leaned forward and said in a measured voicethen this lady is the daughter of your son ramoseso i believe o king although i never knew her mother as i toldpharaoh amasis in the past years ago a queen named atyra came fromsyria on an embassy to apries my lord a beautiful woman who i heardfell in love with my son andthe king will spare me for we in egyptare modest and it is not our custom to talk of such matters to mennow able to bear no more i was about to cry out that she lied when aeunuch who had drawn near to me gripped my arm and handling hisdagger whispered in my earunless you seek instant death be silentthen i refrained my lips bethinking me that while i lived there wasstill hope in death there could be noneall of us understand royal chloe said the king with a false smileindeed i remember hearing of this queen atyra a very fair woman whowent to stir up egypt against us of babylon and returned no more soenough of her now one more question my royal guest and i will ceaseto trouble you a man called belus an evildoer who fled from babylonwhen i was young because of some crime he had committed appeared herenot long ago and was pardoned through the foolishness of the lateking my father to whom he was a cousin this man having beenreinstalled in his offices for by trade he is a priest and anecromancer stated to the king in my presence that the lady myrayonder was not a princess of the royal blood of egypt as pharaohamasis had declared but the lowborn wife of an egyptian namedramose a son of pharaoh apries and the lady chloe believing whichmy father publicly put away the lady myra and from that day till hisdeath never looked upon her face again is this tale true or falseroyal chloehow can it be other than false o king cried my mother in a highand rapid voice seeing that for years myra dwelt with my son as hisacknowledged daughter first in cyprus and afterwards in egypt whereshe herself often spoke to me of him as her father and where hesuffered suitors to ask her hand as that of his daughter moreover didthey not live in my house at memphis as father and daughter lastlyif this were not so should i have told pharaoh amasis that she was mysons daughter when he sought for a lady of the royal blood to be sentas a wife to the king nabonidus further if they were wed how comesit that i his mother was never asked to be present when he took heras his bridethus she spoke in a torrent of words until she ceased from want ofbreathit is enough said belshazzar when the interpreter had renderedthem all i thank you who with the wind of truth have blown awaycertain mists of falsehood which perplexed me who purpose both forreasons of policy and of love here he devoured myra with his fierceand greedy eyes to repair the wrong done in error to your sonsdaughter by my father nabonidus one ever easy to deceive by takingher to wife thus wiping away that insult with the highest honour ican bestow be pleased to withdraw royal chloe till we meet againpresently at my feast when these nuptials will be declared in yourchamber you will find certain gifts not unworthy of her from whomsprang a queen of babylon with which i trust you will adorn yourbeauty at the feast also the decrees conferring upon you titles ofnobility which in chaldea we think highwhen these words had been translated belshazzar rose and bowed to mymother and shepoor besotted creature prostrated herself before himas in her youth she was wont to do before pharaoh whose woman she hadbeen then muttering thanks she withdrew with her followingforgetting in her joy and triumph even so much as to look at me herson who although she guessed it not she had condemned to deathwhen she was gone belshazzar dismissed most of those who stood abouthim so that there remained only a scribe a captain and foursoldiers three eunuchs big fat fellows with villainous wrinkledcountenances who as i heard afterwards were the chosen ministers ofhis pleasures and some veiled women attending upon myra who from theway in which they moved to me appeared to be jailers rather thanwaitingmaids they went and there followed a space of heavy silencelike to that which precedes the bursting of a tempest all there felti think that something terrible was about to happen for even thesoldiers and the hardfaced eunuchs looked moved and expectantbelshazzar descended from his high chair and stood in front of meglowering his evil face full of hate and jealous rageyou have heard he said in that horrible soft voice of his nowwhat have you to say halfbred dog of an egyptian whose mother was agrecian strumpet you who came to babylon upon a vile errand beforeyou speak learn that all this while you have been known and watchedaye even while i was absent after you were taken spying for cyrusunder a false name the king my father protected you because you havesome smatterings of learning and flattered him he died and you andthe traitor who is known as belus strove to escape with yonder ladyunder an order that you had cheated from him but my officersoutwitted you the lady was taken in the gate though owing to a stormbred of the wizardry of belus you and he vanished as i think afterkilling my officer then you took shelter under the robe of the hebrewprophet who is called belteshazzar knowing that none dare touch youthere because of the superstitions of the babylonians who believe thathis house is fenced by spirits from the underworld there perhapsyou might have stayed safe enough had it not pleased you to make useof that poor wretch whose corpse you saw but now as a gobetween withthe lady myrain answer to your messages she wrote you a letter which was seizedcopied and then delivered by your tool obil today another letterwas forged and given to you to serve as bait to draw the jackal fromhis hole you came out of your lair and were met by a woman becauseto have sent soldiers to take you would have been dangerous in a citythat is full of treachery thanks to your friend belus and othersthough that woman the wanton adna knew not why she was sentthinking only that she played a part in some love business from whichshe would draw gold so through your own blind folly at last you cameinto my hands where there is no prophet to protect you with the magicof the devil that he worshipshe paused a while glaring and gnashing his teeth then he went onand now from the lips of that vain painted hag your mother luredhere for this purpose we have learned the truth or what will serveas well for who can doubt a mothers testimony concerning the son shebore the lady whom you pretend to be your wife is certified by yourmother to be your own daughter and you are a wretch unfit to live asall here and in egypt will acknowledge yes even amasis himselftherefore i doom you to die who on the head of your private crimeshave piled that of making trouble between babylon and egypt at a timewhen babylon needs egypts help do you hear that you are condemned todiei hear o king that like every maneven the king himselfi amcondemned to die i answered slowly for these words came to me yetbefore i die i would say to you what you know already that all thistale is false whatever my mother may have told you in her vanity anddelusion yonder woman is not my daughter but my wifedog he answered smiting me in the face will you also defile yourown mother well soon we shall hear another story from you doubtlessyou think to pass hence swiftly and without pain it is not so youshall perish very slowly as a monster who would take his own daughterfor a wife and who slanders his mother is doomed to do under ourancient law there is much that i would learn from you ere you yieldyour breath concerning the doings of your familiar belus who isreported to have gone hence to plot against me and babylon with cyrusthe accursed persian soldiers away with him to the torment and heclapped his handsthen myra who all this while had listened immovable sprang forwardand threw herself into my armshe is my husband not my father if he must die let me die withhim she crieddrag her away said the king and they obeyed himyet as she was torn from me she thrust something into my hand whichswiftly i hid in my robe guessing that it was poisonfarewell beloved wife i said soon we shall meet before godsjudgment seat we and this kingas the soldiers haled me towards the curtains the captain who haddeparted to give orders returnedo king he said the kings command cannot be carried out on theinstantwhy not shouted belshazzaro king the tormentors fearing the just vengeance of the king thathe had promised to them because of the death of obil are themselvesall dead yes there they lie dead the four of them having as ithink swallowed their own tongues after the ethiopian fashionsend for others instantly said the kingthen the private scribe prostrated himself sayingo king the business will be long for such instructed devilish folklive by themselves at a distance and it is almost the hour of thegreat feast shall we not behead this man at once and make an endnay belshazzar answered for i would court this daughter of his tothe music of his groans it will be sweethe thought a while then addedbring him to the feast and guard him well placing him under my owneye that i may be sure of him who perhaps is also a magician and canvanish away like belus when the feast is over lead him here againwhere i and my newmade wife will talk with him bid more tormentorsawait us here with their instruments and see to it that they are themasters of their filthy company on your heads be it                             chapter xxi                       the writing on the wallit was the great feast of king belshazzar given to celebrate hiscoming to the throne of babylon to attend which had been summoned allthe satraps high officers and nobles throughout the empire from eastand west and north and south in obedience to the royal command theyhad gathered together in babylon like vultures to the carcase andwaited there until the king returned from war to hold this coronationfeast the enormous central hall of the palace was filled with theirglittering multitude seated at scores of tables all down its lengthand even between the towering side columns that bore up the roof inthe centre there were no columns because this roof did not stretchfrom wall to wall and here the hall was open to the sky nor was oneneeded at this season of the year when no rain fellthe night was hot and the air so still that the thousands of lamps andtorches burned without a flicker even the flame of the candles in thegolden candlesticks that had been taken from the sanctuary of thehouse of god at jerusalem pointed straight to heaven like fingers offirethe kings seat was at the high table and behind him at a distancewas the white wall at the end of the great chamber all down thistable on either side of the throne were placed his noblest lords hisqueens and his concubines flashing in jewelled robes among thesewomen on one side sat myra tall pale beautiful adorned as a brideand on the other side my mother chloe wearing the royal uraeus ofegypt to which she had no right and covered with gems among themupon her heart those that belshazzar had promised to her as his royalgift below this table stood another occupied by officers of the royalhousehold and at this board i ramose was given a place looking uptowards the king so that i might be in the kings eye as he hadcommanded at my back stood armed guards and on either side of mewere chief eunuchs of the household who wore daggers in their beltswhen the countless company was gathered a trumpet blew heralds criedfor silence and the king entered all rose from their seats andprostrated themselves before his majesty lying on the floor like todead men he waved his sceptre not that broken sceptre i had spurnedbut another which a eunuch told me had belonged to a dead kingthereon they stood up again and the feast begani watched it like one in a dream touching nothing of that rich foodwhich to my sight was viler than carrion although with cruel courtesythe eunuchs pressed it on me saying that as this would be my lastmeal it was wise that i should eat drink and be merry then aftertheir beastly fashion the chief of them who had been present thatnight at the audience given to my mother described to me how horriblyi should be made to die also what myra must suffer if she turned fromthe king all too hideous to be writtenmuch wine was drunk and soon it became evident to me watching andlistening to what as i believed were the last voices i should hearon earth that there were two parties in that hall which hated eachother for here and there quarrels flared up suddenly even blows weregiven until the guards who were everywhere put an end to them withheavier blowsat length the king rose and spoke and i who sat not far from himcould hear every word he said he told of the war with the persiansboasting much and saying that cyrus and his generals were already asdead men for though at first they had met with some small successtheir armies had now fallen into a trap and would beat vainly againstthe mighty walls of babylon like little waves against a mountainside some applauded these sayings whereas others received them withmutterings especially those whose sons and brothers had fallen in thebattles or been taken prisoners and sold as slavesi have good news for you lords rulers captains and people ofbabylon went on the king there has been trouble between us andegypt brought about by spies mischiefmakers and liarshere as ithought he glared at me that trouble is at end pharaoh is our allyagain and will support us with his armies in our struggle against thepersian dogs to seal our pact this very night i take to wife a ladyof the royal blood of egypt and he pointed to myra who sat still asa woman carved in stone whereon all who could hear him rose andstared at her appraising her beautyfear not he went on boasting madly i will lead babylon to suchglory as she has never known guided by our ancient gods again i willmake of her the queen of the world there are no gods like to the godsof babylon who have smitten those of all the peoples some talk ofjehovah of the hebrews where is this jehovah behold we have pulledhim down from heaven babylon has sacked his sanctuaries slaughteredhis priests upon his altars of sacrifice and taken his treasures asspoil ho bring in the vessels from his house those glorious vesselsthat were holy in the sight of this fallen cheat jehovahthereon men who were waiting bore in the golden vessels the cups theewers and the basins the receptacles of sacrifice and the lavers thathad been sacked from the temple at jerusalem they bore them in withribald shouts and lo in each of them decked with flowers was setsome image of a god of the empire of chaldea gods of stone and ivoryand wood grinning and triumphant idols they set the vessels down onthe hightable while halfnaked women jeered and mocked at them andinto one of the most splendid belshazzar cast the dregs of his winecryingaccept this drinkoffering o jehovah conquered demon of judahit was done and he fell back upon his throne panting and rolling hisfierce eyes while he waited for the shouts of acclamation that wereto follow upon his vile wordsbut no shouts came at first i knew not why till it seemed to mewhile i wondered as though some shadow was passing down the length ofthat hall yes a winged shadow that could be felt rather than seenthen i understood after the passing of the shadow followed a heavysilence for all were afraid all knew that death was of theircompanythe silence lasted while one might count a hundred then over againstme at the far end of the hall the shadow reappeared and thickenedyes against the white wall that towered high at the back of thekings seat it began to take form and the form it took was that of agreat hand which held a pen of fire such at least was its fashion tomy eyesmorethat hand began to write upon the lofty wall slowly it wrotewith the pen of fire tracing strange characters that i could notread letters of flame which burned more brightly than iron at itswhitest heat and were each of them of the height of a tall manthose of the feasters who sat far off were the first to see thisdreadful writing which the king and those about him saw not becauseit was behind them they stared astonished and terrified in uttersilence they sat still and stared heavy was that unnatural stillnessand dreadful was the gloom which gathered over the lower part of thechamber as though some mighty shape floated there cutting off thelight of the moon and stars yet the lamps shone on beneath and bythem could be seen the white upturned faces and the staring eyes ofall that multitude of watcherswhat ails our guests asked belshazzar gazing at those white facesand those terrorstricken eyes and his voice sounded loud in thequietnow for the first time i noted that myra had risen alone among thewomen she had risen from her seat and stood with her back towards melooking at the wall behind her yes it was she who answered the kingwhich no other dared to dobehold o king she cried and pointed to the wallhe rose he turned he saw the huge black hand that held the pen offire and slowly very slowly drew letters of flame upon the whitedplaster of the wall where they shone and sparkled like to the coalsof a furnace heated manifold then he sank down in a huddled heap uponthe edge of the table crying such words as thesewhat witchcraft have we here come forward appear all ye mysoothsayers and magicians and show me the interpretation of thiswriting to him who can read it i will give a great reward aye andset him up as a ruler in babylonpresently from this place and that among the seats allotted to theirfellowships and colleges and elsewhere gathered the soothsayers themagicians and all who were reckoned the wisest among the chaldeans inthe arts of divination they advanced to the dais they studied thecharacters of flame which one by one continued to start forth upon theplaster on the wall but of them they could read nothingappeared a lady who wore a crown upon her white hair she came to theking whose body shook and whose face was ashen with fearo king my son live for ever she cried let daniel the prophet ofjudah be summoned he who among the chaldeans is named belteshazzarfor in him is the spirit of the holy gods he will interpret thiswriting as he interpreted many dark visions to nebuchadnezzar theking who went before theeso in his terror the king commanded that daniel known as belteshazzarshould be brought before him tall thin solemnfaced blackrobedwhitehaired he was led through the feasters to the dais as hepassed the table where i sat he turned and looked at me with hisquiet eyes as though in reproach and wonderment then he looked at theeunuchs and armed guards around me also at myra in her bridal robesupon the dais and seemed to understand he climbed the dais and stoodbefore the king making no obeisancebelshazzar lifted his face from the cloth in which he had hidden itand spoke with daniel in a low voice as i think offering him giftsbut what he said and what daniel answered i could not hear at lengththe prophet stepped back to the end of the dais and gazed upward atthe letters which flamed upon the wall for now the hand that wrotethem with a pen of fire was seen no morethis is the meaning of the writing o thou king that mockest the mosthigh god and defilest the vessels of his house cried the prophet inso loud a voice that all in the hall could here numbered numberedweighed and divided yea thy days are numbered yea thou art weighedupon the balances yea thy kingdom is brought to an end the medesand the persians take itnow the king drew near to daniel imploring the prophet to take awaythis curse or offering him gifts i know not which for the groans offear that rose from all who heard covered up his words but theprophet waved him back and turning departed from that hall lookingneither to right nor leftin silence he went in silence all watched him go then as though ata word of command suddenly there was tumult a madness fell upon thecompany and the rage of terror women screamed men raved and shoutedthe king flung himself face downward on the table rolling his headfrom which the crown had fallen from side to side a faintingconcubine caught at a tall light and overset it firing her robes andrushed shrieking to and fro here and there men drew swords frombeneath their cloaks and struck at the lamps extinguishing them asthough their use was ended and their message given the fiery lettersupon the wall faded and vanished so that at last the only light leftin the great place was that which came from the moon floating overhead then voices crieddown with belshazzar away with the tyrant kill the cruel dog whotears us and brings maledictions upon us kill the blasphemer shutthe doors stab the guards and i understood that there was rebellionherethose for the king and those against him began to fight and diegroans echoed everywhere belshazzar sprang up and accompanied by hiscourt lords and women rushed towards the private entrance behindthem seeking to escape for they knew that the curse had fallen andthe hour of doom was near some of that glittering mob were overthrownand trampled among them my mother i heard her scream my name i sawher fall and vanish beneath the stamping feet forgetting everything irose to rush to her aid for was she not still my mother nonehindered me for hoping to save themselves the eunuchs and the guardshad gone i know not where i snatched up a jewelled sword that hadfallen from some princes hand i leapt on to the dais and ran to thespot where i had last seen my motherthere she lay her fair face crushed her splendid robes red withblood already a thief had been at work upon her jewels one of theblack slaves for i caught sight of him slinking away with thenecklaces glittering in his hand more he had driven a knife into herthroat to still her struggles while he robbed her she was dead yespoor foolish woman such was the end of her and all her vanitiesi bethought me of myra and looked round at that moment the moon thathad been half hidden by a cloud shone out fully lo there she sat inher place at the high table whence she had never stirred so stillthat i thought she must be dead so beautiful that i wondered for amoment whether it were she herself or perhaps her spiritleaping over the fallen who lay some quiet some yet struggling ihastened to her she saw me and whisperedi awaited you let us away from this hellaye but whither i asked the doors are closedshe sprang from her chair sayingfollow mea man appeared it was the captain of those eunuchs who had sat by meat the feast and told me of the torments i must endure and of theshame that would be worked on myra he tried to seize her shoutingshe is the kings for in his mad bewilderment the poor wretch couldonly bethink him of his duty and that he must guard the royal womeni ran him through with the sword as he went down his long dark cloakfell from him i caught it up and threw it over myras gorgeous bridalrobe drawing the hood over her head then heeding him no more thoughit would have been wiser to make sure that he was dead we ran onfollowing the wall myra came to a screen of cedarwood behind whichservingmen were wont to pass bearing dishes as she remembered whoknew the palace well she peered down the little passage to learnwhether it were empty and i glanced back at the hall as myra hadsaid it was a hell in which everywhere men were murdering each otherand thieves plied their business fiercely there being much to stealmany however were trying to escape rushing madly from door to doorto find them barred in obedience to the command of the conspiratorsmost of them doubtless in the pay of cyrus the persian who had hopedthus to catch and kill the kingyelling they ran to and fro while their enemies coming after hackedthem down and ere the breath had left them thieves from among thepalace servants and even soldiers who having no pay lived by whatthey could seize robbed them of their finerysuch was the end or at least the last i saw of belshazzars mightycoronation feast the greatest that ever had been held in babylonyes these terrors and towering above them white in the moonlightthe wall whereon but now gods finger had written his decreewe crept down the passage and came to the court of the scullions offwhich opened the kitchens and the quarters of the cooks a village inthemselves we fled across that court and found another that myra didnot know for many a city was smaller than this palace here beneathawnings and columned porticoes men and women were revelling on thisfestal night for as yet news of what had chanced in the great halldid not appear to have reached them from the look of these women andall that passed around us i guessed at once that this was the quarterof the players and dancers also of the courtesans who were makingmerry with their gallantswhile we hesitated hiding ourselves as best we could the tidingscame whence i could not see the men thrust away their darlings andsprang up drawing their swords and gazing about them suspiciouslydiscovering us after demanding their password which we could notgive certain of them began to hunt us shouting that we were spieswho must be killed we slipped away from them and hid in the deepshadows of a portico while they ran about like hounds that have lostthe scenta woman glided up to us and peered into my faceah i thought it she said now friend if you would save yourselfand that beautiful companion of yours follow me for i tell you thatwolves are on your trailwho are you i gasped doubtfullyhow soon men forget the voices of those they thought fair enough tohold close not a sunrise ago she said with a light laughthen i knew that this was the lady of the litter one whom i couldtrust and whispered to myra that she must come our guide passed onthrough many gloomy passages and we followed leaving the shoutsbehind uswho is this woman asked myra suspiciously and whither does shetake usher name is adna i answered one in whom i have faith oh staynot to question she is our only hopea poor one i think murmured myra yet she obeyed me and wassilentat length we came to a little door which adna opened with a key thathung to her girdlehearken friend she said this door has no good name yet it mayserve your turn for it leads from the palace wall to the street thatis called great descend those steps there are twelve of them andturn down the passage to the right where i think there is no guardand you will be in that street where no one will note you farewellfriend thus i pay you and someone else for a certain honest kissfarewell and may the gods who have forgotten me always remember youas i shallthen the door shut behind us we ran down the steps we followed thepassage at the end of which used as a shelter from sun and rain bythe sentry who watched this gate was a niche in the wall that now wasempty as adna had said it would be why i do not know watching ourmoment we slipped out into the street called great where many peoplewere afoot although the hour grew late all of these were disturbedas was shewn by their gestures and the way in which they chattered toeach other doubtless some rumour of the terrible happenings in thepalace had reached them or other news of which i knew nothingtherefore as it chanced we were little observed for when itsinhabitants felt the cold shadow of the arm of god stretched out overbabylon they took no heed of one whom they held to be some courtnoble passing with a cloaked womanwhither go we whispered myraanywhere away from this accursed palace i replied as though athazard but all the while i was wondering where we could shelter inone place onlythe guesthouse of danielthat was the answer it wasfortunate indeed that during the weary months that i had lain hiddenin this house i had so often beguiled the time by studying the streetsof babylon from its high roof for now the knowledge i had gained cameto our aid following these as i saw them in my mind i led myra fromone to another until at length before us was the mount crowded withdwellings on the crest of which were the walls of the old temple thathid the secret entrance to the prophets guesthouse to encouragemyra i pointed to thembehold our refuge i whisperedthen may we gain it swiftly for oh ramose we are followedi glanced back it was true two cloaked men were dogging us spies isupposed or watchers sent out when myra was missed perhaps thatcaptain of the eunuchs whom i had cut down gave the alarm before hediednow run your best i said and clinging to my arm she did so thoughall her finery and the heavy cloak weighed her down and cumbered herfeetwe reached the walls and rushed into them by the little twisting pathnow the men were not more than twenty paces from us and i must almostcarry myra yet in that dim uncertain light for the moon was sinkinglow behind the citys great encircling wall they lost sight of usturning to the right whereas we had turned to the left into the mouthof the path i stumbled on dragging myra with me we came to thehidden door then with horror i remembered that it was locked and thati had no key also that at this hour of the night it would be hard torouse the servants who slept far away oh surely we were lost for ifwe knocked or called those men would hear us and return i gazed atmyra and i think that even through that gloom she must have seen theagony on my face for she pantedwhat now belovedonly this myra if you still have that poison make it ready unlessyou would be borne back to yonder palacewhere belshazzar waitsnever she exclaimed and began to search in her robes while i didlikewise to find the bane which she had given me in the presencechamber that i might use it now should the sword fail methen when all seemed lost the god we worshipped spoke a word in heavenand saved us suddenly the door opened we rushed through it shutagain and the bolts went homebe silent whispered a voice out of the darkness be silent andstir not and i knew it for that of the man nabel who on theafternoon of this very day had brought me the basket of figs which hidthe forged letterwe stood still as the dead and next moment heard footsteps outside thedoorperhaps they went in here said a voicenot so answered a second voice surely i saw them run the otherwaystill ought we not to seek help and break down the door which we haveno tools to do said the first voice it seems strong and islockednay let it be came the reply for i have no mind to tramp back tothat palace where all is drunken riot and fighting perhaps to get aspear through the belly for my pains nay i shall wait till dawn andmake report to the captain of the inner gate according to theestablished custom in the matter of palace fugitives we have ourclue it is enough come brother i know a tavern not half a mileaway where they dont quarrel with late comers and the mistress keepsgood wine we will go sleep thereso be it for we have done our best but be careful of that trinketsaid the first voice then the pair of them tramped off wearilynabel led us down the passage to a little chamber at the foot of thestairs where a lamp burned by the light of which he looked at uscuriouslyhow came you to be at that door friend i askedmy lord the prophet returned here a little while ago master andbade me watch by it till daylight and if i heard any without to openat once and should it be you and a lady to admit you and closeswiftly these things i did and it seems at the right time thoughhow he knew that you were coming he did not sayi stared at him who also wondered how he knew that we were comingthen i askedwhere is the prophet we would speak with himyou cannot master he told me that he was leaving babylon instantlyand would not return before tomorrow if then after which hedeparted with some cloaked companions whom he met without will younot ascend food and wine are set in the eatingchamber as theprophet commanded and one waits you there oh be not afraid she isa woman and harmlesstaking the lamp we crept up the stairs i going first with my swordready on a couch in the eatingchamber sat a woman moaning androcking herself to and fro she looked up and we saw that it wasmetepoh my fosterling she cried in a thick voice my fosterling whom ithought dead and your husband the lord ramose also who thosechambergirls said had been taken to the tortureroom aliveboth ofyou alive oh that holy man must be a godwhat holy man i askedthe prophet i was at the back of the hall when the fighting beganand i fled screaming with other womeni know not where then suddenlythe prophet appeared among us he took me by the hand he led me awayand i remember no more till i found myself in this place oh

me round myarm to serve as a shield for i had none soon the soldiers broke inthe door and reaching the foot of the stair rushed up at us boldlyfor they were brave fellows also moreover the king watched frombelow i drove my sword through the throat of the first and he fellthe second cut at me over his body i warded the blow with the cloakbut his sword shore through it and wounded me in the head causingblood to run into my eyesback cried nabel and i staggered past him up the stair to theroof nabel fought with the third man and it seemed slew him then hejoined me on the roof where myra

hewould throw her to the soldiers while i died in torment before hereyes he defied cyrus and the persians vowing that he would burn themliving hundred by hundred he would burn them all he beat the airgnashing his teeth till at last able to bear no more i strove tospring at him but being wounded in the thigh as well as on the headcould not and fell downbelshazzar drew a knife purposing to finish me yet in the end darednot because nabel still stood over me sword in hand though he mightnot move so he began to mock again and talk of the manner in which weshould perishhark he said my servants
