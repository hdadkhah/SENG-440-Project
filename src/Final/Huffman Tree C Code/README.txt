README FOR SOURCE FILES

huffman-t.c: The functions printOrder(), structure() and padding() were added to get a visual representation of the Huffman tree for our symbols with frequencies. It was not actually used in our implementation. Use -lm when compiling with gcc or else the #define will return an error.

germanLUT.c: The resulting Huffman code words were entered into what looks like a C function, but it ended up not being used. The unsigned integer values resemble the ones from huffman-t.c, with 1 representing binary 0 and 2 representing binary 1, then being used one digit at a time to faciliate bitwise masking.

huffman.c: Our code built from scratch that uses a lookup table. It actually outputs bytes that say '1' or '0' for readability, but making an actual bit-sized implementation is easily done.

xst-console-output.txt: Output generated by XST on attempting to synthesize the design in huffman_decoder.vhd.

The VHDL folder contains all the VHDL sources described in the report. Further comments can be found in the source files themselves.
